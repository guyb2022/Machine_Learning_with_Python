October 9 to 11, 2019: congress techLING



January 31, 2020: article submission





Submissions

-----------



Abstract submission



Each participant may submit up to two abstracts, which must not exceed 300 words nor five keywords, in one of the working languages of the conference (Portuguese or Galician, Spanish, French, Italian and English). It is recommended that you follow APA guidelines, structuring the text as follows: identification of the topic, objective, methodology (sample, instrument and procedure), results and conclusion. In the abstract all sections should be presented in a concise manner, especially the Results section. If your study does not have an empirical basis, the abstract should have the structure of a theoretical study: identifying the theoretical approach or model and linking current and past results.



Submission guidelines



Submission of abstracts is made exclusively through the Easychair platform (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=techling19). If you do not have an account, you must create it following the instructions available on the platform's website.



Until September 17, 2019 participants will be notified of the decision regarding acceptance of their abstract and whether it was accepted for the intended type of presentation or whether any changes have been suggested.

Article submission



The studies presented in each of the four tracks could be submitted for further publication in special issues of the following scientific journals:



    Tracks 1 and 2: Revista de Humanidades Digitais, H2D.

    Track 3: LinguaMÁTICA. Note that the articles of LinguaMÁTICA should be written in one of the main languages of the Iberian Peninsula.

    Track 4: Research in Corpus Linguistics (RiCL) journal.



The presentation of a study in techLING does not mean that the article will be accepted by the journal, since each of these publications has independent review processes."
"1624351495-430","http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=computational%20linguistics&page=16","NERSSEAL 2008","http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=6&copyownerid=9","Call for Papers



Papers are invited on substantial, original, and unpublished research on all aspects of Named Entity Recognition (NER) for South and South East Asian (SSEA) languages. At least one of the languages considered should be an SSEA language. We also invite researchers to be contestants in a shared task (the second track of the workshop) on NER for SSEA languages.

Background and Motivation



Most of the SSEA languages are scarce in resources as well as tools and NER systems are no exception. It is very important that good systems for NER be available, because many problems in information extraction and machine translation (among others) are dependent on accurate NER. However, the issues involved are significantly different for these languages from those for European languages or even East Asian languages. For example, these languages do not have capitalization, which is a major feature for NER systems for European languages.



Another similarity among these languages is that most of them use scripts of Brahmi origin. For some languages, there are additional issues like word segmentation (e.g. for Thai). Large gazetteers are not available for most of these languages. There is also the problem of lack of standardization and spelling variation. The number of frequently used words which can also be used as names is very large for many languages, unlike European languages where a larger proportion of the first names are not used as common words. And most importantly, there is a serious lack of labeled data for machine learning.

Scope



This workshop will be the second stage of an annual event called NLPAI Machine Learning Contest which focuses on application of machine learning techniques for one major NLP problem every year. This year the problem was NER. However, unlike that event, this workshop will have one track for regular research papers on NER for SSEA languages and the second track will be on the lines of a shared task.

Shared Task



In the shared task, the contestants having their own NER systems will be given some annotated test data. The participating systems will be ranked according to their performance on the test data. There may or may not be training data for a particular language. In either case, the contestants will have the freedom to use any technique for NER, e.g. a purely rule based technique or a purely statistical technique.



At present some data is available for Hindi, Bengali and Telugu for the shared task. Other languages can be included in the contest provided data for them becomes available. The data released for the shared task will be made accessible to all researchers, not just the participants.



If the language you are interested in has not been included in the shared task, you can also prepare the annotated test data and submit it to us. We will then include that language in the shared task.



The task in this contest will be different in one important way. The NER systems also have to identify nested named entities. For example, in the sentence The Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration is located in Mussoorie, 'Lal Bahadur Shastri' is a Person, but 'Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration' is an Organization. In this case, the NER systems will have to identify both 'Person' and 'Organization' in the given sentence.

Submission



Paper submission is through the centralized workshop submission page. Papers have to be written in English. Note that shared task contestants also have to submit a paper describing their method and the results etc. Long or short papers can be submitted to either of the tracks. Long papers can be up to 8 pages long, while the maximum length for short papers is 5 pages (including references, figures, tables etc.). All selected papers will be published in the workshop proceedings.



The papers should be formatted using the LaTeX styles or MS Word templates recommended for the main IJCNLP conference. These documents are available here. Reviewing will be blind. The draft papers should not contain any information that can identify the authors, as far as possible.

Important Dates



    * Release of Training and Development Data: Aug 2 to Aug 25, 2007 (for different languages)

    * Release of Test Data: Sept 13, 2007

    * Annotated Test Data Submission Deadline: Sept 15, 2007

    * Paper Submission Deadline: Sept 21, 2007

    * Notification of Paper Acceptance: Oct 26, 2007

    * Camera Ready Submission Deadline: Nov 16, 2007



Note: There is no separate registration for the shared task(the contest). You will be a contestant if you submit the annotated test data by the deadline mentioned above.

This workshop on Controlled Natural Language (CNL) has a broad scope and embraces all approaches that are based on natural language and apply restrictions on vocabulary, grammar, and/or semantics. This includes (but is certainly not limited to) approaches that have been called simplified language, plain language, formalized language, processable language, fragments of language, phraseologies, conceptual authoring, language generation, and guided natural language interfaces.



Some CNLs are designed to improve communication among humans, especially for non-native speakers of the respective natural language. In other cases, the restrictions on the language are supposed to make it easier for computers to analyze such texts in order to improve computer-aided, semi-automatic, or automatic translations into other languages. A third group of CNL has the goal to enable reliable automated reasoning and formal knowledge representation from seemingly natural texts. All these types of CNL are covered by this workshop.

Important Dates

---------------



Paper submission deadline: November 4, 2011

Author response period: December 27-30, 2011

Notification of acceptance: January 13, 2012

Camera-ready papers due: March 9, 2012

Papers available on-line: April 19, 2012

EACL 2012 Conference: April 23 - 27, 2012



All deadlines refer to 11:59pm Samoa time (UTC/GMT -11 hours)





Requirements

------------



Papers should describe original work; they should emphasize completed

work rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state

of completion of the reported results. A paper accepted for

presentation

at EACL 2012 cannot be presented at any other meeting with publicly

available published proceedings. Papers that are being submitted to

other conferences or workshops must indicate this on the submission

page. If the paper is accepted by both EACL 2012 and another meeting

or publication, it must be withdrawn from one of them. Furthermore,

its authors must notify the program chairs, within a week of receiving

the EACL 2012 acceptance notification, whether or not they have chosen

EACL 2012 for presentation of their work.





Review and Selection

--------------------



Reviewing of papers will be double-blind, and all submissions

will receive  three independent reviews.

Final decisions on the program will be made by the Program Committee,

consisting of the Program Co-Chairs and Area Chairs.

Submissions will be assessed with respect to appropriateness, clarity,

soundness/correctness, meaningful comparison, originality/innovativeness,

and impact of ideas or results.





Publication and Presentation

----------------------------



All papers that are accepted will be published in the proceedings

of the conference, and will be presented orally or as a poster

presentation  as determined by the program committee. The decisions

as to which papers  will be presented orally and which as poster

presentations will be based

on the nature rather than on the quality of the work.

Authors will be also  asked on submission to state their preferred

mode of presentation.

EACL 2012 will continue aiming to give poster presentations a high

status.

There will be no distinction in the conference proceedings between

papers  that are assigned different presentation modes.





Submission Information

----------------------



All submissions must be submitted electronically as PDF and must

follow the two-column format of EACL proceedings. Authors are strongly

recommended to use the style files available on the conference web

site. Papers may consist of up to nine (9) pages of content and any

number of additional pages containing references only.



EACL 2012 will also accept papers accompanied by the resource(s)

(software or data) described in the paper. In addition to the regular

review of the research quality of the paper, these papers will also be

reviewed for the quality of the resource that is being made

available. Acceptance or rejection decision will be made based on the

quality of both the research and the software/data component.



As reviewing will be double-blind, the paper should not include the

authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that

reveal the author's identity, e.g., ""We previously showed (Smith,

1991) ..."", should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ""Smith

previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."". Authors should not use anonymous

citations and should not include any acknowledgments. Papers that do

not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.



The deadline for submission is 11:59pm Samoa Time (UTC/GMT -11 hours)

on November 4, 2011.  Additional instructions for electronic submission

will be posted on the conference website at http://eacl2012.org





Mentoring service

-----------------



EACL is providing a mentoring (coaching) service for authors from

regions of the world where English is less emphasized as a language of

scientific exchange. Many authors from these regions, although able to

read the scientific literature in English, have little or no

experience in writing papers in English for conferences such as the

E/ACL meetings. If you would like to take advantage of the service,

please upload your paper in PDF format by September 23, 2011 using the

paper submission software for the mentoring service which will be

available at the conference website. Questions about the mentoring

service should be referred to(add email address)

*** THIRD WORKSHOP ON CONTROLLED NATURAL LANGUAGE (CNL 2012) ***



29-31 August 2012

Zurich, Switzerland



http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/site/cnl2012/



---------------------------------------------------------------------





A controlled natural language (CNL) is based on natural language but

comes with restrictions on vocabulary, grammar, and/or semantics. The

general goal is to reduce or eliminate ambiguity and complexity.



Some of these languages are designed to improve communication among

humans, especially for non-native speakers of the respective natural

language. In other cases, the restrictions on the language are

supposed to make it easier for computers to analyze such texts in

order to improve computer-aided, semi-automatic, or automatic

translations into other languages. A third group of CNL has the goal

to enable reliable automated reasoning on seemingly natural texts.

Such languages have a direct mapping to some sort of formal logic and

should improve the accessiblity of formal knowledge representations

or specifications for people unfamiliar with formal notations.



All these types of CNL are covered by this workshop.





Topics

------



Possible topics for CNL 2012 include:



- CNL for knowledge representation

- CNL for question answering

- CNL for specifications

- CNL for business rules

- CNL for interactive systems

- CNL for machine translation

- CNL for improved understandability of texts

- design of CNLs

- CNL applications

- CNL evaluation

- usability and acceptance of CNL

- CNL grammars and lexica

- reasoning in CNL

- spoken CNL

- CNL in the context of the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data

- CNL in the government

- CNL in industry

- CNL use cases

- theoretical properties of CNL





Important Dates

---------------



Submission deadline (extended):  13 April 2012

Notification of acceptance:      28 May 2012

Deadline for revised papers:     18 June 2012

Workshop:                        29-31 August 2012





Submissions and Proceedings

---------------------------



We invite researchers to submit papers with novel contributions in

the area of CNL. These research papers should be formatted according

to the Springer LNCS format and should not exceed 15 pages (but

AIMS AND SCOPE



Argumentation is a rapidly expanding multidisciplinary research area at the confluence of diverse fields such as philosophy, communication studies, logic and artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, social sciences, political sciences, and law. The contributions coming from these heterogeneous disciplines and the large number of potential applications that can be triggered by these studies have made argumentation one of the hottest topics within the artificial intelligence community with immediate relevance to the Web, distributed computing, and mobile systems. 



The Internet and the Web have inspired a variety of real-world applications for argumentation, since social media, social networks, and distributed platforms are some of the favorite sources and outlets for opinions, advice, and comments of any sort for a large share of the world population, and this type of content could very well lend itself to argumentative analysis. However, current argumentative analysis methodologies are costly and pose clear issues of scalability, since they are mainly manual or only semi-automated, and they require a great deal of expertise. Indeed, current text-based social media analytics mainly focuses on approaches such as sentiment analysis, and does not yet consider argument analysis. Sentiment analysis lets us analyze the users' opinions about certain topics, but falls short of identifying the reasons for the opinions expressed and the users' chains and patterns of reasoning.



Recently we have observed tremendous interest and rapid expansion of argumentation mining -- the process of automatically extracting arguments from unstructured text -- as a means of filling this gap. Developing enabling platforms for formal and informal argumentation in distributed settings, mining dynamic natural language text, managing consistency and accuracy in data representation, and information presentation and visualization at large are very important and certainly challenging domains for argumentation mining. Social networks and social media in particular provide high-throughput, highly heterogeneous and highly dynamic sources of data, which are likely to include significant argumentative content. With argumentation mining, the potential behind the combination of social media and argumentation studies has grown, encompassing domains such as social issues and public policy, with applications ranging from the analysis of the dynamics of social debates on the Web to the detection of anomalous behavior; and from the study of how influential arguments spread and become dominant within social networks to the role of specific users within this kind of process. 



The aim of this TOIT special section is to address the important challenges that argumentation in the Web poses, involving the perspective of distributed computing. These include, but are not limited to, the development of algorithms and architectures for mining large volumes of highly dynamic unstructured or semi-structured data especially natural language text coming from social media; the definition of appropriate models and structures that enable processing and visualizing such data; the privacy, trust, legal, and ethical issues related to the management and processing of user-generated argumentative content; the development of enabling platforms for formal and informal argumentation in distributed and agent-based environments; the management of consistent and accurate data representations; the novel use of resources such as ontologies and vocabulary systems; and the presentation of large, complex, community-based argumentative content in a usable way.





TOPICS



A list of topics to be covered by this special section includes, but is not limited to a set of areas listed below.



Foundations

·  Information models of user-generated arguments and debate in social media

·  Argumentation-enabled collective intelligence and collaboration

·  Security, privacy, trust, and ethical issues related to argumentative analysis



Methods and technologies

·  Mining and visualization of large volumes of highly dynamic data

·  Argumentation and social informatics, social computing, and crowdsourcing

·  Innovative semantic search methods, algorithms, and tools

·  Middleware and APIs for online debating technologies



Applications

·  Argumentation mining in social media

·  Processing of user reviews for online entertainment, e-commerce, and e-business applications

·  Argumentation for e-learning

·  Argumentation analysis for policy making

·  Argumentation and online debates and mining for e-government

Call For Papers



Under the denomination ""multiword expression"", one assumes a wide range of

linguistic constructions such as idioms (storm in a teacup, sweep under

the rug), fixed phrases (in vitro, by and large, rock'n roll), noun

compounds (olive oil, laser printer), compound verbs (take a nap, bring

about), etc. While easily mastered by native speakers, their

interpretation poses a major challenge for computational systems, due to

their flexible and heterogeneous nature.



For starters, MWEs are not nearly as frequent in NLP resources as they are

in real-word text, and this problem of coverage may impact the performance

of many NLP tasks. Moreover, treating MWEs also involves problems like

determining their semantics, which is not always compositional (to kick

the bucket meaning to die). In sum, MWEs are a key issue and a current

weakness for natural language parsing and generation, as well as real-life

applications depending on language technology, such as machine

translation, just to name a prominent one among many.



Thanks to the joint efforts of researchers from several fields working on

MWEs, significant progress has been made in recent years, especially

concerning the construction of large-scale language resources. For

instance, there is a large number of recent papers that focus on

acquisition of MWEs from corpora, and others that describe a variety of

techniques to find paraphrases for MWEs. Current methods use a plethora of

tools such as association measures, machine learning, syntactic patterns,

web queries, etc. A considerable body of techniques, resources and tools

to perform these tasks are now available, and are indicative of the

growing importance of the field within the NLP community.



Many of these advances are described as part of the annual workshop on

MWEs, that attracts the attention of an ever-growing community working on

a variety of languages and MWE types. The workshop has been held since

2001 in conjunction with major computational linguistics conferences (ACL,

COLING, LREC and EACL), providing an important venue for the community to

interact, share resources and tools and collaborate on efforts for

advancing the computational treatment of MWEs. Additionally, special

issues on MWEs have been published by leading journals in computational

linguistics. The latest such effort is the special issue on “Multiword

Expressions: from Theory to Practice and Use”, currently under publication

from the ACM Transactions on Speech and Language Processing

(http://multiword.sourceforge.net/PHITE.php?sitesig=SPECIAL).



MWE 2013 will be the 9th event in the series. We will be interested in

major challenges in the overall process of MWE treatment, both from the

theoretical and the computational viewpoint, focusing on original research

related (but not limited) to the following topics:



- Manually and automatically constructed resources

- Representation of MWEs in dictionaries and ontologies

- MWEs in linguistic theories like HPSG, LFG and minimalism

- MWEs and user interaction

- Multilingual acquisition

- Multilingualism and MWE processing

- Models of first and second language acquisition of MWEs

- Crosslinguistic studies on MWEs

- The role of MWEs in the domain adaptation of parsers

- Integration of MWEs into NLP applications

- Evaluation of MWE treatment techniques

- Lexical, syntactic or semantic aspects of MWEs



The workshop is endorsed by ACL SIGLEX, the Special Interest Group on the

Lexicon of the Association for Computational Linguistics.



Submission modalities



For MWE 2013, we will accept the following submission modalities:



Regular long papers (8 content pages + 1 page for references): Long papers

should report on solid and finished research including new experimental

results, resources and/or techniques.

Regular short papers (4 content pages + 1 page for references): Short

papers should report on small experiments, focused contributions, ongoing

research, negative results and/or philosophical discussion.



The reported research should be substantially original. The papers will be

presented orally or as a posters. The decision as to which papers will be

presented orally and which as poster will be made by the program committee

based on the nature rather than on the quality of the work. All

submissions must be in PDF format and must follow the NAACL 2013

formatting requirements (available at the NAACL 2013 website). We strongly

advise the use of the provided Word or LaTeX template files.



Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information should be

included in the papers; self-reference should be avoided as well.



Resources submitted with the papers should be anonymized for submission.

Papers and/or resources that do not conform to these requirements will be

rejected without review. Accepted papers will appear in the workshop

proceedings, where no distinction will be made between papers presented

orally or as posters.



More details about the submission procedure (e.g. online submission

system) will be available soon.

Webpage: http://csc-master.media.mit.edu/cskgoi/





Overview:



  When interacting with user interfaces, users have to bridge the gap between their goals expressed in mental terms and the interface's structures and functions expressed in physical terms. This gap has been characterized as the ""Gulf of Execution"", and it may imply significant cognitive processing on the users' side in order for them to successfully accomplish their goals.

  If user interfaces could understand, at a high-level, our goals, our problems, and our social procedures, users could have cognitively accessible, dynamic interfaces accommodating their unique needs, beyond the range of applications anticipated by the designers.

  For computers to realize such a goal-oriented paradigm,

 * They must have access to information about the world that human users take for granted. This information, which forms the basis for goal-directed computer interactions, is common sense knowledge.

 * They must provide for algorithms and techniques that are capable of acquiring and structuring knowledge about user goals.

 * They must have adequate means to represent knowledge about user goals in a way that allows for reasoning and inference about them.

 * They must provide for user interfaces that effectively map users' goals on the computer's functionalities and structures.

  This workshop has the goal of bringing together researchers from different domains that share an interest in common sense knowledge and goal-oriented knowledge representations in the context of intelligent user interfaces.

THIRD WORKSHOP ON HYBRID APPROACHES TO TRANSLATION (HyTra 2014)



Co-located with EACL 2014 http://eacl2014.org/ 



Gothenburg, Sweden



April 27, 2014



Deadline for paper submissions: February 7, 2014



http://sites.google.com/site/hytra2014



=========================================================================





WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION



The aim of the HyTra workshop series is to bring together researchers developing and applying statistical, example-based, or rule-based translation systems, and those enhancing MT systems by combining elements from different approaches, to promote discussion and sharing of ideas among them. Hereby one relevant focus is on effectively combining linguistic and data driven approaches (rule-based and statistical MT). Another focus is on hybridization in the context of human translation.



The 3rd Workshop on Hybrid Approaches to Translation (HyTra-3) intends to continue developing and empowering the research agenda in the area of Hybrid Translation already started at its first and second editions. The previous two editions (see http://www-lium.univ-lemans.fr/esirmt-hytra/ and http://hytra.barcelonamedia.org/hytra2013/) were co-located with EACL 2012 in Avignon and with ACL 2013 in Sofia, and the proceedings were published on the ACL Anthology.







TOPICS



We solicit contributions including but not limited to the following topics:



- ways and techniques of hybridization

- architectures for the rapid development of hybrid MT systems

- applications of hybrid systems

- hybrid systems dealing with under-resourced languages

- hybrid systems dealing with morphologically rich languages

- using linguistic information (morphology, syntax, semantics) to enhance statistical MT 

  (e.g. with hierarchical or factored models)

- using contextual information to enhance statistical MT

- bootstrapping rule-based systems from corpora

- hybrid methods in spoken language translation

- extraction of dictionaries and other large-scale resources for MT from parallel and comparable corpora

- induction of morphological, grammatical, and translation rules from corpora

- machine learning techniques for hybrid MT

- describing structural mappings between languages (e.g. tree-structures using 

  synchronous/transduction grammars)

- heuristics for limiting the search space in hybrid MT

- alternative methods for the fair evaluation of the output of different types of MT systems 

  (e.g. relying on linguistic criteria)

- system combination approaches such as multi-engine MT (parallel) or automatic post-editing (sequential)

- open source tools and free language resources for hybrid MT







SUBMISSIONS



Contributions can be short or long papers. Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work without exceeding five pages of content plus one extra page for references. Characteristics of short papers include: a small, focused contribution; work in progress; a negative result; an opinion piece; an interesting application nugget. Long paper submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work without exceeding eight pages of content plus two extra pages for references. Submissions will be judged according to the criteria of the main conference (EACL 2014).



Authors are invited to submit papers on original and previously unpublished work. Formatting should be according to EACL 2014 specifications using LaTeX or MS-Word style files, see section ""submission format"" at http://eacl2014.org/call-for-papers. Reviewing of papers will be double-blind, so the submissions should not reveal the authors' identity.



Submission is electronic in PDF format using the START submission system at the URL to be provided on the Workshop Website.



Double submission policy: Parallel submission to other meetings or publications is possible but must be immediately notified to the workshop contact person (see below). If accepted, withdrawals are only possible within two days after notification.



For an accepted paper to appear in the proceedings, at least one author must register for the workshop and actually present the paper. The papers will be published in the workshop proceedings which will be made available via the ACL Anthology.

CALL FOR PAPERS

=======================



The 13th Linguistic Annotation Workshop (The LAW XIII)

https://sigann.github.io/LAW-XIII-2019



Held in conjunction with ACL 2019, Florence/Italy, August 2019

Sponsored by the ACL Special Interest Group on Annotation (SIGANN)







WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION

========================



Linguistic annotation of natural language corpora is the backbone of supervised methods for statistical natural language processing. It also provides valuable data for evaluation of both rule-based and supervised systems and can help formalize and study linguistic phenomena.



The LAW provides a forum for presentation and discussion of innovative research on all aspects of linguistic annotation, including creation/evaluation of annotation schemes, methods for automatic and manual annotation, use and evaluation of annotation software and frameworks, representation of linguistic data and annotations, evaluation of manual and automatically-produced annotations, etc.





SPECIAL THEME

=======================

We encourage submission of papers relating to this year's special theme: ***marking of information quality in discourse***, i.e., annotations that mark how the speaker/writer expresses assessments. These assessments may be explicit and/or implicit in discourse, and may reflect positions, beliefs, opinions, appraisals and/or assessments about written or spoken propositions, for example, how a politician shows in discourse the degree of truthfulness in one of his/her electoral promises, or how a reporter shows his/her degree of belief in what the politician stated. This might include the annotation of devices such as hedges (“Donald claims that the crowd size, if you can really trust him to measure it, was enormous.”), committed belief (“The winners of the contest will be announced tomorrow.“) or attitudes (“It is with great sadness that we have learnt about the death of 6 people in the accident.”).





WORKSHOP TOPICS

=======================

We welcome submissions of long and short papers, posters, and demonstrations, relating to the topics of the special theme and to any aspect of linguistic annotation, including:



== Annotation procedures ==

- Innovative automated and manual strategies for annotation.

- Machine learning and knowledge-based methods for automation of corpus annotation.

- Creation, maintenance, and interactive exploration of annotation structures and annotated data.



== Annotation evaluation ==

- Inter-annotator agreement and other evaluation metrics and strategies.

- Qualitative evaluation of linguistic representation.



== Annotation access and use ==

- Representation formats/structures for merged annotations of different phenomena, and means to explore/manipulate them.

- Linguistic considerations for merging annotations of distinct phenomena.



== Annotation schemes, guidelines and standards ==

- New and innovative annotation schemes, comparison of annotation schemes.

- Best practices for annotation procedures and/or development and documentation of annotation schemes.

- Interoperability of annotation formats and/or frameworks among different systems as well as different tasks, frameworks, modalities, and languages.

- Results on the application and evaluation of standards for (linguistic) annotation.



== Annotation software and frameworks ==

- Development, evaluation and/or innovative use of annotation software frameworks.





SUBMISSIONS and REVIEWING

=========================



Submissions should report original and unpublished research on topics of interest for the workshop. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop, and will be published in the workshop proceedings. They should emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results.



A paper accepted for presentation at the workshop must not be or have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings.



Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system. The submission site will be announced shortly.



Long/short paper submissions must use the official ACL 2019 style templates. Long papers must not exceed eight (8) pages of content. Short papers and demonstration papers must not exceed four (4) pages of content. References do not count against these limits.



Note: The supplementary material does not count towards page limit and should not be included in paper, but should be submitted separately using the appropriate field on the submission website.

All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to the official style guidelines, which are contained in the template files that will become available on the conference website shortly.



Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore, the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations or self-references that reveal the authors’ identity, e.g., ""We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."" should be replaced with citations such as ""Smith (1991) previously showed ..."". Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

Authors of papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must provide this information to the workshop co-chairs. Authors of accepted papers must notify the program chairs within 10 days of acceptance if the paper is withdrawn for any reason.



If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the program co-chairs (law-xiii-2019-chairs@googlegroups.com).

evaluation and analysis should be included. Submissions will be judged

on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance and

relevance to the conference, and interest to the attendees. Each

submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee

members.



Full papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus one

extra page for references, and will be presented orally or as a poster

presentation as determined by the program committee.  The decisions as

to which papers will be presented orally and which as poster

presentations will be based on the nature rather than on the quality

of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings between

full papers presented orally and those presented as poster

presentations.



The deadline for full papers is February 22, 2009 (GMT + 8).

Submission will be electronic using paper submission software that

will be available at the conference website.



Short papers: ACL-IJCNLP 2009 solicits short papers as well. Short

paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. The

short paper deadline is just about three months before the conference

to accommodate the following types of papers:



- A small, focused contribution

- Work in progress

- A negative result

- An opinion piece

- An interesting application nugget



Short papers will be presented in one or more oral or poster sessions,

and will be given four pages in the proceedings. While short papers

will be distinguished from full papers in the proceedings, there will

be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers presented

orally and those presented as poster presentations. Each short paper

submission will be reviewed by at least two program committee

members. The deadline for short papers is April 26, 2009(GMT + 8).

Submission will be electronic using paper submission software that

will be available at the conference website.



Format:



Full paper submissions should follow the two-column format of

ACL-IJCNLP 2009 proceedings without exceeding eight (8) pages of

content plus one extra page for references. Short paper submissions

should also follow the two-column format of ACL-IJCNLP 2009

proceedings, and should not exceed four (4) pages, including

references. We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or

Microsoft Word Style files tailored for this year's conference, which

will be available on the conference website. All submissions must

conform to the official ACL-IJCNLP 2009 style guidelines to be

announced in the conference website and they must be electronic in

PDF.



As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not include the

authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that

reveal the author's identity, e.g., ""We previously showed (Smith,

1991) ..."", must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ""Smith

previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."". Papers that do not conform to

these requirements will be rejected without review.



Multiple-submission policy:



Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or

publications must provide this information at submission time. If

ACL-IJCNLP 2009 accepts a paper, authors must notify the program

chairs by April 19, 2009 (full papers) or June 7, 2009 (short papers),

indicating which meeting they choose for presentation of their work.

ACL-IJCNLP 2009 cannot accept for publication or presentation work

that will be (or has been) published elsewhere.



Mentoring Service:



ACL is providing a mentoring (coaching) service for authors from

regions of the world where English is less emphasized as a language of

scientific exchange. Many authors from these regions, although able to

read the scientific literature in English, have little or no

experience in writing papers in English for conferences such as the

ACL meetings. The service will be arranged as follows. A set of

potential mentors will be identified by Mentoring Service Chairs Ng,

Hwee Tou (NUS, Singapore) and Reeder, Florence (Mitre, USA), who will

organize this service for ACL-IJCNLP 2009. If you would like to take

advantage of the service, please upload your paper in PDF format by

January 14, 2009 for long papers and March 18 2009 for short papers

using the paper submission software for mentoring service which will

be available at conference website.



An appropriate mentor will be assigned to your paper and the mentor

will get back to you by February 8 for long papers or April 12 for

short papers, at least 2 weeks before the deadline for the submission

to the ACL-IJCNLP 2009 program committee. Please note that this

service is for the benefit of the authors as described above. It is

not a general mentoring service for authors to improve the technical

content of their papers.



If you have any questions about this service please feel free to send

a message to Ng, Hwee Tou (nght@comp.nus.edu.sg) or Reeder, Florence

(floreederacl@yahoo.com).

OVERVIEW



This year's workshop will feature five shared tasks:



    a translation task,

    a (pilot) automatic post-editing task (NEW),

    a tuning task (optimize a given MT system, NEW, a follow-up of the WMT11 tunable metrics task),

    a quality estimation task (assess MT quality without access to any reference),

    a metrics task (assess MT quality given reference translation). 



In addition to the shared tasks, the workshop will also feature scientific papers on topics related to MT. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:



    word-based, phrase-based, syntax-based, semantics-based SMT

    using comparable corpora for SMT

    incorporating linguistic information into SMT

    decoding

    system combination

    error analysis

    manual and automatic method for evaluating MT

    scaling MT to very large data sets



We encourage authors to evaluate their approaches to the above topics using the common data sets created for the shared tasks.



TRANSLATION TASK



The first shared task which will examine translation between the following language pairs:



    English-German and German-English

    English-French and French-English

    English-Finnish and Finnish-English NEW

    English-Czech and Czech-English

    English-Russian and Russian-English



The text for all the test sets will be drawn from news articles except for (NEW) the French-English set, which will be drawn from user-generated comments on the news articles. Participants may submit translations for any or all of the language directions. In addition to the common test sets the workshop organizers will provide optional training resources, including a newly expanded release of the Europarl corpora and out-of-domain corpora.



All participants who submit entries will have their translations evaluated. We will evaluate translation performance by human judgment. To facilitate the human evaluation we will require participants in the shared tasks to manually judge some of the submitted translations. For each team, this will amount to ranking 300 sets of 5 translations, per language pair submitted.



We also provide baseline machine translation systems, with performance comparable to the best systems from last year's shared task.

AUTOMATIC POST-EDITING TASK



This shared task will examine automatic methods for correcting errors produced by machine translation (MT) systems. Automatic Post-editing (APE) aims at improving MT output in black box scenarios, in which the MT system is used ""as is"" and cannot be modified. From the application point of view APE components would make it possible to:



    Cope with systematic errors of an MT system whose decoding process is not accessible

    Provide professional translators with improved MT output quality to reduce (human) post-editing effort



In this first edition of the task, the evaluation will focus on one language pair (English-Spanish), measuring systems' capability to reduce the distance (HTER) that separates an automatic translation from its human-revised version approved for publication. Training and test data are provided by Unbabel.

QUALITY ESTIMATION TASK



Quality estimation systems aim at producing an estimate on the quality of a given translation at system run-time, without access to a reference translation. This topic is particularly relevant from a user perspective. Among other applications, it can (i) help decide whether a given translation is good enough for publishing as is; (ii) filter out sentences that are not good enough for post-editing; (iii) select the best translation among options from multiple MT and/or translation memory systems; (iv) inform readers of the target language of whether or not they can rely on a translation; and (v) spot parts (words or phrases) of a translation that are potentially incorrect.



Research on this topic has been showing promising results in the last couple of years. Building on the last three years' experience, the Quality-Estimation track of the WMT15 workshop and shared-task will focus on English, Spanish and German as languages and provide new training and test sets, along with evaluation metrics and baseline systems for variants of the task at three different levels of prediction: word, sentence, and document.

METRICS TASK

The metrics task (also called evaluation task) will assess automatic evaluation metrics' ability to:



    Rank systems on their overall performance on the test set

    Rank systems on a sentence by sentence level



Participants in the shared evaluation task will use their automatic evaluation metrics to score the output from the translation task and the tunable metrics task. In addition to MT outputs from the other two tasks, the participants will be provided with reference translations. We will measure the correlation of automatic evaluation metrics with the human judgments.

TUNING TASK

In the tuning task is a follow up of WMT11 invitation-only tunable metrics task. The task will assess your team's ability to optimize the parameters of a given hierarchical MT system (Moses).



Participants in the tuning task will be given complete Moses models for English-to-Czech and Czech-to-English translation and the standard developments sets from the translation task. The participants are expected to submit the moses.ini for one or both of the translation directions. We will use the configuration and a fixed revision of Moses to translate official WMT15 test set. The outputs of the various configurations of the system will be scored using the standard manual evaluation procedure.

PAPER SUBMISSION INFORMATION



Submissions will consist of regular full papers of 6-10 pages, plus additional pages for references, formatted following the EMNLP 2015 guidelines. In addition, shared task participants will be invited to submit short papers (4-6 pages) describing their systems or their evaluation metrics. Both submission and review processes will be handled electronically. Note that regular papers must be anonymized, while system descriptions do not need to be.



We encourage individuals who are submitting research papers to evaluate their approaches using the training resources provided by this workshop and past workshops, so that their experiments can be repeated by others using these publicly available corpora.

POSTER FORMAT

The posters will be attached to self standing posterboards measuring 3 ft high and 4 ft wide and sitting on top of tables so there will be laptop/handout space as well. We will provide pushpins, double-sided tape, that putty-like substance, and clips to affix the posters to the posterboards."

September 14-16, 2016 – University of Salamanca (Spain)



http://www.congresocedi.es/sepln





INTRODUCTION

-----------------------

The 32nd. Edition of the International Conference of the Spanish Society for Natural Language Processing (SEPLN) will take place at the University of Salamanca (Salamanca, Spain) on 14-16 September 2016. The SEPLN 2016 will be held in conjunction with CEDI 2016 (http://www.congresocedi.es/).



The huge amount of information available in digital format and in different languages calls for systems to enable us to access this vast library in an increasingly more structured way. In this same area, there is a renewed interest in improving the information accessibility and information exploitation in multilingual environments. Most of the formal foundations for dealing appropriately with these necessities have been, and are still being, established in the area of Natural Language Processing and its many branches: Information extraction and retrieval, Questions answering systems, Machine translation, Automatic analysis of textual content, Text summarization, Text generation, and Speech recognition and synthesis.



The aim of the conference is to provide a forum for discussion and communication where the latest research work and developments in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be presented by scientific and business communities. The conference also aims at exposing new possibilities of real applications and R&D projects in this field.



Moreover, as in previous editions, there is the intention of identifying future guidelines or paths for basic research and foreseen software applications, in order to compare them against the market needs. Finally, the conference intends to be an appropriate forum in helping new professionals to become active members in this field.



This year we will organise a Doctoral Symposium. It will provide doctoral students investigating topics in natural language processing with a unique opportunity to have interaction with other researchers and receive feedback regarding their proposed research.

### SCOPE

CREOL aims at gathering together researchers from different communities (Applied Ontology, NLP, AI, Semantic Web) to investigate the relationship between the semantic representation of objects and events and their context, from an ontological and linguistic perspective.



Dealing with context is a key factor in the conceptualisation of human experience, and thus a major issue for understanding natural language. It is well known that some properties of objects and events may be activated according to their context of occurrence, and thus determine selective access to salient aspects.



Current ontologies and lexicons (e.g. DOLCE [1], Unified Verb Index [2])) offer limited (meaning) representations of events and objects that then may find different realisations in text. Additionally, the growing interest towards multimodal information systems requires devising approaches and resources aimed at representing context by considering different sources (e.g., textual description, image, video) as a whole.



Contextual access to objects and events needs to be investigated at its interface with language and visual scene, as well. Recently, several advanced approaches have been proposed to model meaning representations of lexical items in their context (e.g., Deep contextualised word representations [3]). Likewise, approaches and resources have been designed to represent and make explicit the relations intervening between objects in scenes depicting events (e.g., Visual Genome [4]). Moreover, established theories of meaning representation allow for the representation of context to varying extent (e.g., Abstract Meaning Representation [5], Discourse Representation Theory [6]).



The goal of this workshop is to promote and discuss the design of ontologies, linguistic resources, and computational methods that treat context as a primary focus of interest.

==============================

. . . . . . . . COVID-19 UPDATE . . . . . . . . 



Due to the coronavirus crisis, IJCAI-PRICAI 2020 has been delayed until January 2021. The AI4Function workshop will be held together with IJCAI-PRICAI at that time, in a physical or virtual format.



In order to support dissemination of authors' new research results, we will be publishing the proceedings of the AI4Function workshop as planned in Summer 2020. To accommodate our community's needs during this time, we have extended our submission deadline to June 19.

==============================



The First Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Function, Disability, and Health (AI4Function 2020) invites the submission of abstracts, short and long papers describing research that focuses on applying informatics methods, artificial intelligence (AI) or data mining techniques in the area of whole-person care, disability, and functional status information.  Functional Status Information (FSI) describes physical and mental wellness at the whole-person level (as opposed to the cellular or organ level), and includes information on activity performance, social role participation, and environmental and personal factors that affect well-being and quality of life.  Collecting and analyzing this information is critical to addressing the data needs in caring for aging global populations, and providing effective care for individuals with chronic conditions, multi-morbidity, and disability.  However, FSI has proven difficult to capture systematically within existing paradigms, leaving a space ripe for technological innovation. AI4Function is a venue for researchers cutting across data science and AI methods to discuss new ways to collect and utilize FSI within healthcare delivery, public health, and social well-being.





TOPICS

Relevant topics for the workshop include, but are not limited to:

-	Informatics methods applied to FSI, including information extraction, information retrieval, and classification of FSI (e.g. mobility, self-care, mental functioning)

-	Applications of AI for functional status measurement

-	Usage of FSI to model health outcomes/resource utilization

-	Terminologies and ontologies related to functional status

-	Analysis of FSI data (e.g., language data, wearable measurements)

-	Combinations of multi-modal data to capture functional status



Data sources of interest include, but are not limited to:

-	Medical records

-	Disability and work programs 

-	Health and human services data

-	Wearable devices

-	Social media



Targeted data types include, but are not limited to:

-	Unstructured (free text) narrative

-	Structured medical data (e.g., lab reports, range of motion assessments) 

-	Semi-structured reports (e.g., state welfare visit reports)

-	Standardized clinical surveys (e.g., PROMIS, AM-PAC, PHQ-9)

-	Population surveys

-	Wearable device measurements

-	Video and audio recordings





SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

All submissions to AI4Function should be anonymous using the EasyChair submission site (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ai4function).  Papers should follow IJCAI-PRICAI 2020 guidelines. Formatting guidelines, LaTeX and Word templates are available in the IJCAI authors kit: https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit

At least one author of each accepted paper/abstract must register for and attend the workshop. 



We invite three types of submissions:

-	Long papers: no longer than seven pages in total: six pages for the main body of the paper (including figures), and one additional page for references that don’t fit in the six body pages.  Long papers are expected to describe reports of original, unpublished research.

-	Short papers: follow a 4+1 format, up to four pages for the body of the paper and one page for references that don’t fit within the four-page limit.  Short papers are appropriate for preliminary results, work in progress, etc.

-	Abstracts: are a maximum of two pages, including references. Unlike long/short papers, abstracts can describe previously-published research, and are a great way to present recent work to a new audience or show work in progress.  For abstracts, a 75-word short description should be provided in the submission form, but does not need to be included in the abstract content.



Authors are required to submit their papers in PDF format. Papers that are longer than the page limit will be rejected without review.



All submissions to AI4Function will go through a double-blind reviewing process. Accepted abstracts will be presented in the poster session. Accepted papers will be presented as either a talk or a poster, depending on the reviewers’ recommendations.



Accepted short and long papers will be published in the workshop proceedings on CEUR-WS.  We are exploring a journal track for extended versions of accepted papers (TBC).





CONFIDENTIALITY POLICY

AI4Function will adopt the IJCAI confidentiality policy, where all submissions will be treated in strict confidence until the publication date. 





CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY

All individuals involved in the AI4Function review process must adhere to the IJCAI conflict of interest policy. Details can be found at http://ijcai.org/

                       Last Call for Papers



18th Annual Conference of the European Association for Machine

Translation (EAMT 2015; Antalya, Turkey)

---------------------------------------------------------------------



The European Association for Machine Translation

(EAMT,http://www.eamt.org) invites everyone interested in machine

translation, translation-related tools and resources to participate in

this conference -- developers, researchers, users, professional

translators and translation/localisation managers: anyone who has a

stake in the vision of an information world in which language barriers

and issues become less visible to the information consumer. We

especially invite researchers to describe the state of the art and

demonstrate their cutting-edge results, and professional MT users to

share their experiences.



EAMT 2015, the 18th Annual Conference of the European Association for

Machine Translation, will be held in Antalya, Turkey from 11 to 13 May

2015.



We expect to receive manuscripts in these three categories:



-------------------------------------------------------------

(R) Research papers

-------------------------------------------------------------

Long-paper submissions (8 pages) are invited for reports of

significant research results in any aspect of machine translation and

related areas. Such reports should include a substantial evaluation

component, or have a strong theoretical and/or methodological

contribution where results and in-depth evaluations may not be

appropriate. Papers are welcome on all topics in the area of machine

translation or translation-related technologies, including:



* Speech translation: speech to text, speech to speech

* Translation aids (translation memory, terminology databases, etc.)

* Translation environments (workflow, support tools, conversion tools

  for lexica, etc.)

* Practical MT systems (MT for professionals, MT for multilingual

  eCommerce, MT for localization, etc.)

* MT in multilingual public service (eGovernment etc.)

* MT for the web

* MT embedded in other services

* MT evaluation techniques and evaluation results

* Dictionaries and lexica for MT

* Text and speech corpora for MT

* Standards in text and lexicon encoding for MT

* Human factors in MT and user interfaces

* Related multilingual technologies (natural language generation,

  information retrieval, text categorization, text summarization,

  information extraction, etc.)



Papers should describe original work. They should emphasize completed

work rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state

of completion of the reported results. Where appropriate, concrete

evaluation results should be included.



-------------------------------------------------------------

(U) User studies

-------------------------------------------------------------

Short-paper submissions (2-4 pages) are invited for reports on users'

experiences with MT, be it in small or medium size business (SMB),

enterprise, government, or NGOs. Contributions are welcome on:



* Integrating MT and computer-assisted translation into a translation

  production workflow (e.g. transforming terminology glossaries into

  MT resources, optimizing TM/MT thresholds, mixing online and offline

  tools, using interactive MT, dealing with MT confidence scores);

* Use of MT to improve translation or localization workflows

  (e.g. reducing turnaround times, improving translation consistency,

  increasing the scope of globalization projects);

* Managing change when implementing and using MT (e.g. switching

  between multiple MT systems, limiting degradations when updating or

  upgrading an MT system);

* Implementing open-source MT in the SMB or enterprise

  (e.g. strategies to get support, reports on taking pilot results

  into full deployment, examples of advance customisation sought and

  obtained thanks to the open-source paradigm, collaboration within

  open-source MT projects);

* Evaluation of MT in a real-world setting (e.g. error detection

  strategies employed, metrics used, productivity or translation

  quality gains achieved);

* Post-editing strategies and tools (e.g. limitations of traditional

  translation quality assurance tools, challenges associated with

  post-editing guidelines);

* Legal issues associated with MT, especially MT in the cloud

  (e.g. copyright, privacy);

* Use of MT in social networking or real-time communication

  (e.g. enterprise support chat, multilingual content for social

  media);

* Use of MT to process multilingual content for assimilation purposes

  (e.g. cross-lingual information retrieval, MT for e-discovery or

  spam detection, MT for highly dynamic content);

* Use of standards for MT.



Papers should highlight problems and solutions and not merely describe

MT integration process or project settings. Where solutions do not

seem to exist, suggestions for MT researchers and developers should be

clearly emphasized. For user papers produced by academics, we require

co-authorship with the actual users.



-------------------------------------------------------------

(P) Project/Product description

-------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract submissions (1 page) are invited to report new, interesting:



* Tools for machine translation, computer aided translation, and the

  like (including commercial products and open-source software). The

  authors should be ready to present the tools in the form of demos or

  posters during the conference.

* Research projects related to machine translation. The authors should

  be ready to present the projects in the form of posters during the

  conference. This follows on from the successful ‘project villages’

  held at the last EAMT conferences.



-------------------------------------------------------------

Programme

-------------------------------------------------------------

The programme will include oral presentations and poster

sessions. Accepted papers may be assigned to an oral or poster

session, but no differentiation will be made in the conference

proceedings.

ENDORSED BY SIGPARSE



August 24, 2014 in Dublin, Ireland, co-located with COLING 2014





http://www.spmrl.org/spmrl-sancl2014.html



*** NOTE THE EXTENDED Submission Deadline: June 6, 2014 ***







The CFP below is for the SPMRL-SANCL Main Workshop.  The workshop also features:



    Second Shared Task on Semi-Supervised Parsing of Morphologically Rich Languages

    http://www.spmrl.org/spmrl2014-sharedtask.html



    Special Track on the Syntactic Analysis of Non-Canonical Language

    http://www.spmrl.org/sancl-posters2014.html



Follow the links for more details on the Shared Task and Special Track.





Motivation



Statistical parsing of morphologically-rich languages (MRLs) and syntactic analysis of non-canonical languages (NCL) have shown several similar properties and challenges in recent research. Therefore, this year we organize a joint workshop of these two research communities, to foster cross-pollination of ideas and technology for both.



Statistical parsing of morphologically-rich languages has repeatedly been shown to exhibit non-trivial challenges including, among others, sparse lexica in the face of rich inflectional systems, parsing deficiency in the face of free word order and treebank annotation idiosyncrasies in the face of morphosyntactic interactions.



Similar problems arise for parsing of non-canonical languages. Besides technical issues such as lexical sparseness and ad-hoc structures, we also face theoretical problems including constructions that do not occur, or very seldom occur, in standard language, such as verbless sentences or complex hashtags.



The first joint SPMRL-SANCL workshop addresses both the challenge of parsing MRLs and NCL. It provides a forum for researchers addressing the often overlapping issues of both fields with the goal of identifying cross-cutting issues in the annotation and parsing methodology for such languages.





AREAS OF INTEREST



The areas of interest of the SPMRL-SANCL workshop include, but are not limited to, the following list of topics:



* applying cutting-edge parsing techniques to new languages and domains



* identifying the strengths and weaknesses of current parsing techniques when applied to morphologically-rich and/or non-canonical language



* developing techniques that are targeted at improving parsing quality of morphologically-rich and/or non-canonical language



* developing models and architectures that explicitly integrate morphological analysis and parsing



* addressing data sparseness due to lexical variants, out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and noise, ad-hoc syntactic rules, non-canonical word order, ungrammatical structures, or disfluencies



* using insights from parsing and associated processing problems to motivate decisions in the creation of new syntactically annotated corpora (""treebanks""), especially in domains, genres, and languages that are not yet, or hardly covered; tag set design



* discussing the role of parsing in higher-level NLP applications involving MRLs and NCLs, e.g. syntax-enhanced MT and semantic analysis.









SECOND SHARED TASK ON SEMI-SUPERVISED PARSING OF MORPHOLOGICALLY RICH LANGUAGES



The workshop will also host the second shared task on parsing morphologically rich language (see http://spmrl.org/spmrl2014-sharedtask.html).  The first shared task was held in conjunction with SPMRL 2013.  It helped show that carefully engineered approaches can help to push the envelope on languages such as Hungarian, Basque, Hebrew and Polish, where the shared task results for constituency parsing are the best current known for those languages. The task embodied a focus on realistic scenarios (no gold tokenization, no gold part-of-speech or morphology), as well as meaningful evaluation measures, including a cross-framework evaluation that permits comparisons between constituent and dependency parsing models.  



The second installment of the Shared Task will feature a similar range of languages. Moreover, it will also consider a semi-supervised scenario where larger quantities of in-domain text are available. These unlabeled data are aimed to be used for self-training, co-training, lexical acquisition, generating word clusters, word embeddings and so on. A separate call for the Shared Task is forthcoming.





SPECIAL TRACK ON SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS OF NON-CANONICAL LANGUAGE



In addition to regular paper submissions, we solicit poster submissions addressing the syntactic analysis of frequent phenomena of non-canonical language, which are difficult to annotate and parse using conventional annotation schemes. Cases in point are the representation of verbless utterances in a dependency scheme, the pros and cons of different representations of disfluencies for statistical parsing, or the analysis of complex hashtags which incorporate and merge different syntactic arguments into one token. The posters should focus, in more detail, on one more of these issues.  More details on the submission categories for the poster session can be found below and at:   http://spmrl.org/sancl-posters2014.html .

9th WORKSHOP ON BUILDING AND USING COMPARABLE CORPORA



Special Topic: Continuous Vector Space Models and Comparable Corpora



Shared Task: Identifying Parallel Sentences in Comparable Corpora



https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2016/



Monday, May 23, 2016



Co-located with LREC 2016, Portorož, Slovenia

  

DEADLINE FOR PAPERS: February 10, 2016



============================================================



MOTIVATION



In the language engineering and the linguistics communities, research

on comparable corpora has been motivated by two main reasons. In

language engineering, on the one hand, it is chiefly motivated by the

need to use comparable corpora as training data for statistical

Natural Language Processing applications such as statistical machine

translation or cross-lingual retrieval. In linguistics, on the other

hand, comparable corpora are of interest in themselves by making

possible inter-linguistic discoveries and comparisons. It is generally

accepted in both communities that comparable corpora are documents in

one or several languages that are comparable in content and form in

various degrees and dimensions. We believe that the linguistic

definitions and observations related to comparable corpora can improve

methods to mine such corpora for applications of statistical NLP. As

such, it is of great interest to bring together builders and users of

such corpora.





SHARED TASK



There will be a shared task on ""Identifying Parallel Sentences in

Comparable Corpora"" whose details will be described on the

workshop website (URL see above).





TOPICS



Beyond this year's special topic ""Continuous Vector Space Models and 

Comparable Corpora"" and the shared task on ""Identifying Parallel 

Sentences in Comparable Corpora"", we solicit contributions including

but not limited to the following topics:



Building comparable corpora:



  * Human translations

  * Automatic and semi-automatic methods

  * Methods to mine parallel and non-parallel corpora from the Web

  * Tools and criteria to evaluate the comparability of corpora

  * Parallel vs non-parallel corpora, monolingual corpora

  * Rare and minority languages, across language families

  * Multi-media/multi-modal comparable corpora



Applications of comparable corpora:



  * Human translations

  * Language learning

  * Cross-language information retrieval & document categorization

  * Bilingual projections

  * Machine translation

  * Writing assistance



Mining from comparable corpora:



  * Cross-language distributional semantics

  * Extraction of parallel segments or paraphrases from comparable corpora

  * Extraction of translations of single words and multi-word expressions, 

    proper names, named entities, etc.





IMPORTANT DATES



  February 10, 2016    Deadline for submission of full papers

     March 10, 2016    Notification of acceptance

SUBMISSION INFORMATION



Papers should follow the LREC main conference formatting details (to be

announced on the conference website http://lrec2016.lrec-conf.org/en/ )

and should be submitted as a PDF-file via the START workshop manager at



  https://www.softconf.com/lrec2016/BUCC2016/



Contributions can be short or long papers. Short paper submission must

describe original and unpublished work without exceeding six (6)

pages. Characteristics of short papers include: a small, focused

contribution; work in progress; a negative result; an opinion piece;

an interesting application nugget. Long paper submissions must

describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work without

exceeding ten (10) pages.



Reviewing will be double blind, so the papers should not reveal the

authors' identity. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop

proceedings.



Double submission policy: Parallel submission to other meetings or

publications is possible but must be immediately notified to the

workshop organizers.



Please also observe the following two paragraphs which are applicable

to all LREC workshops as well as to the main conference:



Describing your LRs in the LRE Map is now a normal practice in the 

submission procedure of LREC (introduced in 2010 and adopted by other 

conferences). To continue the efforts initiated at LREC 2014 about 

“Sharing LRs” (data, tools, web-services, etc.), authors will have 

the possibility,  when submitting a paper, to upload LRs in a special 

LREC repository.  This effort of sharing LRs, linked to the LRE Map 

for their description, may become a new “regular” feature for conferences 

in our field, thus contributing to creating a common repository where 

everyone can deposit and share data.



As scientific work requires accurate citations of referenced work so 

as to allow the community to understand the whole context and also 

replicate the experiments conducted by other researchers, LREC 2016 

endorses the need to uniquely Identify LRs through the use of the 

International Standard Language Resource Number (ISLRN, www.islrn.org), 

a Persistent Unique Identifier to be assigned to each Language Resource. 

The assignment of ISLRNs to LRs cited in LREC papers  will be offered at 

submission time.

Conference Theme: Digital Humanities Evolving: Past, Present, and Future

 

Venue: National Chengchi University, Taipei

While the debates over the definition, landscape, and scale of digital humanities continue, digital humanists seem to have a consensus that digital humanities are constantly evolving and facing new challenges.  Take big data as an example.  Technologies automatically and instantly archive what people say, what people do, and even what people think.  The rich information provided by big data leads humanities research to a new frontier that can hardly be imagined by classical humanists.  However, the self-archived data contain real, virtual, and even fake contents.  How shall digital archivists and digital humanists embrace big data and big data analytics?  Alternatively, will the ubiquitous digitization transform human culture and make “digital humanities” simply become “humanities”?

 

Digitalization involves computing.  Digital humanists share the same tools with computational social scientists to extract information, to analyze social network, and to perform geospatial analysis.  Digital humanists have also attempted to apply the tools of computational social sciences to model and simulate the complex human experiences.   In the meanwhile, computational social scientists are exploring sentiment modeling.  When the research tools and topics of interest become common, how far can digital humanists and social scientists collaborate to gain deeper insights into common research problems and cope with shared challenges?   

 

Continuing the legacy of the past 7 annual conferences of DADH, we welcome the submissions of paper or poster abstracts and panel proposals related to, but not limited to, the aforementioned issues, digital technologies and applications, interdisciplinary research in humanities and social sciences with the use of digital data, theoretical and epistemological considerations in digital humanities, digital humanities education, digital arts and music, digital infrastructure, cultural heritage, and internet analysis.

 

Submission Guidelines

COLDOC 2013 aims to examine the notion of genre in a multidisciplinary approach and to illustrate the variety of both theoretical and practical problems it raises. The call for papers is open to a wide variety of contributions that can help identify an essential category for interpretation.



Although it has long remained been restricted to taxonomic approaches, the issue of genre categorisation sees new developments thanks to the interest it has raised in various humanities disciplines, gradually integrating different aspects in their definitional approaches: contexts of utterance, medium (written or spoken), language norms, social practices, etc.



This renewal is also expressed by the fact that the studies less systematically seek to define it through production rules or classificatory categories, but rather try to examine the question of genre through the process of recognition and interpretation. Theoretical approaches and case studies tend to focus on the addressee’s point of view: horizons of expectations, habits, cultural pre-conceptions, cognitive framework, communication circuit, etc. The genre is then modeled as a set of constraints or necessary conditions of meaning.



COLDOC 2013, bringing contributions from diverse backgrounds, aims to review the state of the art and the diversity of work on genres. Relying on theoretical and applied propositions, COLDOC 2013 aims to suggest new descriptive categories needed in the search for meaning in written and oral discourse. This 2013 edition of COLDOC therefore strongly encourages participation from masters students, PhD students candidates and young researchers in general linguistics, corpus linguistics, sociolinguistics, computational linguistics (written or speech) and, more generally, any area that would be interested in the study of genres.



Several issues - solely as examples - can be considered as sources of inspiration. These issues, both theoretical and practical, highlight the variety of possible approaches in the study of textual and oral genres:



    Why categorize according to genres? How should boundaries between genres be established?

    How should genres be defined, formalized and modeled?

    What are the dynamics implied in genre building?

    What are the implied relation(s) between ‘genre’ and ‘linguistic operations’ (describe, summarize, tell…)?

    Does genre influence grammatical phenomena?

    What are the sociolinguistic instantiations of genre?

    How can usage, variety and language registers linguistic variables become genre-specific social markers?

    How does corpus linguistics answer to genre study?

    How can genre study in written productions be applied to oral genres and vice versa?

    What observables is genre assignment based on? Can it be automatically calculated?

    What is the role of genre as a tool for teaching and learning language and literature?

    How can we categorize and interpret the emergence of new linguistic practices according to new communication devices (forums, blogs, social networks, chats, tweets, emails, etc.)?

    Do techniques for automatic analysis of texts and discourses question or redistribute the categorization into genres? Do they contribute to other forms of categorization?

    Is the oral-written distinction a major distinction in the study of genres?

    How can genre be accounted for in the development of NLP resources (lexicon, grammar, parsers, etc.)?

The workshop's website is available under: http://cl.indiana.edu/~zhekova/amcr13



In the last couple of years, the interest in the area of Multilingual Coreference Resolution (MCR) has increased immensely. Two shared tasks (SemEval-2 Shared Task 1: Coreference Resolution in Multiple Languages in 2010 and the CoNLL Shared Task: Modeling Multilingual Unrestricted Coreference in OntoNotes in 2012) have set an excellent benchmark by releasing datasets for 8 different languages (SemEval: Catalan, Dutch, English, German, Italian and Spanish; CoNLL: Arabic, Chinese and English). Moreover, a wide range of multilingual systems have been developed within the framework of the tasks. We see a necessity for future research on the topic of MCR. The lack of existing workshops on the topic motivates our attempt to provide a possibility for the researchers interested specifically on multilinguality with respect to Coreference Resolution to present their work and results. 

The 1st International Workshop on Advances in Multilingual Coreference Resolution (AMCR 2013) workshop will welcome both theoretical and applied computational work regarding MCR. The submissions are expected to discuss theories, applications, evaluation, limitations, system development and techniques relevant to the AMCR topics. Papers that critically evaluate approaches or existing strategies will be especially welcome, as will new and innovative MCR system implementations. There will be a decisive focus on multilinguality for this workshop. Thus, submitted papers should cover at least one language other than English, preferably more. The scope of topics includes, but is not limited, to: 

* Statistical and rule-based approaches to Multilingual CR

* Availability of resources for Multilingual CR

* New resources for Multilingual CR

* CR for languages other than English

* Acquisition of world knowledge for improving Multilingual CR

* Empirical data analysis and comparison of the various annotation CR schemes

* CR across language families

* Event coreference for MCR

* Knowledge-poor and knowledge-rich approaches to Multilingual CR

* Mention detection for entities and events for Multilingual CR

* Language specific issues within the Multilingual CR task

* Parallel corpora for CR

* Submissions



All submitted papers must present substantial, original and not yet published research on a topic that is of interest to the AMCR workshop. The work could include, but is not limited to, detailed analysis and evaluation of proposed new approaches, extensive comparison of previously introduced methods or a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art of multilingual coreference resolution. The submissions will be assessed with respect to their relevance to the workshop, correctness, originality, implementation (if applicable) and significance.



The AMCR 2013 workshop, as part of the RANLP 2013 conference, will accommodate all style requirements for submissions listed on the RANLP's submission page. Please, use these style files, as papers that do not conform to the requirements will not be accepted at the AMCR 2013 workshop. The papers will undergo a blind review process, thus, authors' names, affiliations and self-references that reveal the author's identity must be avoided. Papers that do not conform to any of the above described requirements will be instantly rejected.



Accepted will be the following three formats:



LONG PAPERS: This type of submissions should be no longer than eight (8) content pages. References are not considered as content and may be included with up to two (2) additional pages. Long papers must be presented orally during the workshop session and will be included in the workshop proceedings. Page limits must be strictly observed.



SHORT PAPERS: Short papers should be no longer than four (4) content pages as well as up to two (2) additional pages of references. Short papers will be presented as posters and will be included in the workshop proceedings. Page limits must be strictly observed.



POSTERS: Additionally, the AMCR 2013 workshop will accept posters for the poster session, which will not lead to a publication, but would allow the authors to present and discuss relevant work with the workshop participants. Poster presenters are asked to submit a half page description of the poster.

For Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics (CL) communities, it was a known situation that Arabic is a resource poor language. This situation was thought to be the reason why there is a lack of corpus based studies in Arabic. However, the last years witnessed the emergence of new considerably free Arabic corpora and in lesser extent Arabic corpora processing tools. 



Freely available Arabic corpora can be divided into two groups. The first group contains large Arabic corpora, which are designed and constructed basically for Arabic linguistics research and activities, and maybe for Arabic NLP. These corpora are diverse in the genres they cover and their sizes range from one million words to 700 million words. The second group contains corpora that were designed basically for Arabic text classification and clustering, they mainly contain newspapers' articles. They range from less than 1 million words to 11 million words. 



Some Arabic corpora are available on the web to explore using different tools, basically large corpora, while other corpora are only available for download. For the corpora that are available for download, the user may need to use standalone corpus processing tools. These tools contain many functionality such as word frequency, concordance, collocation, etc.  Therefore, with the availability of large and diverse Arabic corpora, the situation does not change. There is still a lack of Arabic corpus base studies. Is this because of representativeness of these corpora? The available functions and tools associated with these corpora? or is it because they are not well known enough for the Arabic linguistics community? 





Motivation and topics of interest



This half-day-workshop aims to encourage the researchers and developers to foster the utilization of freely available Arabic corpora and open source Arabic corpora processing tools and help in highlighting the drawbacks of these resources and discuss techniques and approaches on how to improve them. The workshop topics include but not limited to:

1.	Surveying and criticizing the design of freely available Arabic corpora, their associated tools and stand alone Arabic corpora processing tools.

2.	The applications and uses of freely available Arabic language resources in fields such as Arabic language education e.g. L1 and L2.

3.	Arabic language modeling.

4.	Corpus based Arabic lexigraphy.

5.	Lexical semantics and word sense.

6.	Corpus based Arabic syntactic.

7.	Corpus based Arabic morphology.

8.	Development of Arabic mobile applications based on the available Arabic language resources.

9.	Evaluation and assessment of Arabic Corpora and Corpora Processing Tools.

10.	Future directions of Free/Open Arabic Corpora and Corpora Processing Tools.





Important Dates



Submission deadline: 10 February 2014

Notification of acceptance: 10 March 2013

Final submission of manuscripts: 21 March 2014

Workshop date: 27 May 2014 (morning session)  



Submission guidelines

The language of the workshop is English and submissions should be with respect to LREC 2014 paper submission instructions. All papers will be peer reviewed possibly by three independent referees.  Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format to the STAR system. When submitting a paper from the START page, authors will be asked to provide essential information about resources (in a broad sense, i.e. also technologies, standards, evaluation kits, etc.) that have been used for the work described in the paper or are a new result of your research. Moreover, ELRA encourages all LREC authors to share the described LRs (data, tools, services, etc.), to enable their reuse, replicability of experiments, including evaluation ones, etc.

Motivation

----------



The past decade has seen tremendous progress in the speed, quality and availability of automatic translation of natural languages. While automatic translation quality still regularly falls short of publication or near-publication quality, contemporary machine translation can deliver a level of quality that may boost the productivity of human translators by providing them with raw translations to work from, ensuring consistency in terminology, and fast access to terminological databases and databases of previous translations in the form of translation memories and bilingual concordances.



Much research in the CL community in recent years has focused on improving fully automatic MT, but we still know comparatively little about how humans translate, and how to optimally organize human-machine interaction in computer-assisted translation. This workshop aims to provide a platform to discuss these issues and to present empirical results, data sets, case studies, and tools for computer-assisted translation and the study of cognitive processes in both fully human and computer-assisted human translation. We particularly encourage submissions related to the following







Topics of interest

------------------



Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, addressing questions such as:



* Behavioral studies of human translators in action. What do they spend their time on? Where do they get stuck? How much context do they need? At what level of understanding do they process the text?



* CAT tools and tools for the study of human translation.



* Features and functions of a CAT user interface. What features do translators require a UI to have? What do they need for a CAT UI to be productive?



* Data sets, especially data sets showing how translations evolve during multi-stage processing in a professional setting (e.g., from junior translator to senior translator to final revision).



* In-depth analyses of both human and automatic translations. What are typical errors? Do professional translators work very differently to casual translators?



* Novel types of assistance for human translators.



* Adapting machine translation systems to the needs of human translators.



* The CAT back-end: SMT vs translation memories and example-based MT, hierarchical vs. phrase-based SMT, other approaches and combinations thereof. What do translators prefer? What are they most productive with?



* Revising the human-computer interaction scheme. How can the machine translation system learn from the user's feedback? Are other interaction protocols such as interactive machine translation better suited? How can an e-pen, a gaze tracking device, a speech recognition system or other multi-modal devices improve translation productivity?







Submissions

-----------



We invite three types of submissions. All must present original, previously unpublished work. Double submission of long or short papers to other conferences and workshops is acceptable as long as this disclosed at the time of submission. It is expected that the workshop organizers are notified immediately if the paper will be published elsewhere. Double submission of demos is allowed.



* long papers that present substantial, completed pieces of work. Long papers can consist of up to 8 pages of text (including tables and figures) and up to two 2 extra pages for references.



* short papers that report on work in progress or pilot studies and small studies. Short papers can consist of up to 5 pages of of text (including tables and figures) plus 1 extra page for references.



* system demos that present CAT systems and experimental setups that showcase novel approaches and new features in human-computer interaction in the context of automated and computer-assisted translation. System demos should be submitted in the same format as the short papers (i.e., maximum 5 pages of text plus 1 extra page for references).







Submissions will be handled electronically via the START Conference Manager System. A link to the specific URL will be posted shortly on the workshop web site. Submissions must be anonymized for double-blind reviewing (i.e., not reveal the identity of the author in any form, including meta-data stored in the file; see the file eacl2014.pdf, which is part of the package linked to below) and be in portable document format (PDF). They should follow the general EACL style guidelines available at http://www.eacl2014.org/files/eacl-2014-styles.zip.



Each submission will be blind reviewed at least by two members of the program committee. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings. In addition, we aim to provide opportunity to publish extended versions of exceptional papers in a special journal edition.

SUBMISSIONS



Long Papers



Long ACL 2017 submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Review forms will be made available prior to the deadlines.



Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited references; final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.



Long papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and which as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings between long papers presented orally and as posters.



Short Papers



ACL 2017 also solicits short papers. Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages. Some kinds of short papers are:



A small, focused contribution

Work in progress

A negative result

An opinion piece

An interesting application nugget



Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given five (5) content pages in the proceedings. Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address reviewers comments in their final versions.



Short papers will be presented in one or more oral or poster sessions. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers presented orally and as posters.



GENERAL NOTES



Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents that are not available to the reviewers. Papers may be accompanied by a resource (software and/or data) described in the paper. Papers that are submitted with accompanying software/data may receive additional credit toward the overall evaluation score, and the potential impact of the software and data will be taken into account when making the acceptance/rejection decisions.



ACL 2017 also encourages the submission of supplementary material to report preprocessing decisions, model parameters, and other details necessary for the replication of the experiments reported in the paper. Seemingly small preprocessing decisions can sometimes make a large difference in performance, so it is crucial to record such decisions to precisely characterize state-of-the-art methods.



Nonetheless, supplementary material should be supplementary (rather than central) to the paper. It may include explanations or details of proofs or derivations that do not fit into the paper, lists of features or feature templates, sample inputs and outputs for a system, pseudo-code or source code, and data. The paper should not rely on the supplementary material: while the paper may refer to and cite the supplementary material and the supplementary material will be available to reviewers, they will not be asked to review or even download the supplementary material. Authors should refer to the contents of the supplementary material in the paper submission, so that reviewers interested in these supplementary details will know where to look.



As the reviewing will be blind, papers must not include authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., ""We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."" must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ""Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."" Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.



Electronic Submission



Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system at



https://www.softconf.com/acl2017/papers  for long papers



https://www.softconf.com/acl2017/shortpapers  for short papers.



Long paper submissions must follow the two-column format of ACL 2017 proceedings without exceeding eight (8) pages of content. References do not count against this limit. Short paper submissions must also follow the two-column format of ACL 2017 proceedings, and must not exceed four (4) pages.  We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files tailored for this year's conference. Submissions must conform to the official style guidelines, which are contained in the style files, and they must be in PDF.



Style files (updated for ACL 2017) and other information about paper formatting requirements are available on the conference website, http://acl2017.org 



Multiple Submission Policy



Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time in an author-blinded cover page, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted by ACL 2017 (see instructions on the submission page). Authors of papers accepted for presentation at ACL 2017  must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper will be presented. We will not accept for publication or presentation papers that overlap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere.



Preprint servers such as arXiv.org and workshops that do not have published proceedings are not considered archival for purposes of submission. Authors must state in the online submission form the name of the workshop or preprint server and title of the non-archival version. The version submitted for review should be suitably anonymized and not contain references to the prior non-archival version. Reviewers will be told: ""The author(s) have notified us that there exists a non-archival previous version of this paper with significantly overlapping text. We have approved submission under these circumstances, but to preserve the spirit of blind review, the current submission does not reference the non-archival version."" Reviewers are free to do what they like with this information.



Authors submitting more than one paper to ACL 2017 must ensure that submissions do not overlap significantly ()25%) with each other in content or results.



Presentation Requirement



All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for ACL 2017 by the early registration deadline.

The 26th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and 

Computation (PACLIC 26) will be held in Bali on November 8-10, 2012, 

organized by the Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia. 

The PACLIC series of conferences emphasize the synergy of 

theoretical analysis and processing of language, and provides a 

forum for researchers in different fields of language study in the 

Pacific-Asia region to share their findings and interests in the 

formal and empirical study of languages. Organized under the 

auspices of the PACLIC Steering Committee, PACLIC 26 will be the 

latest instalment of our long standing collaborative efforts among 

theoretical and computational linguists in the Pacific-Asia region. 



The conference this year marks a special moment as it will be the 

25th anniversary of the PACLIC conference series, and a special 

commemorative event is being planned and organized. 



Paper submissions of original and unpublished research are invited 

on all aspects of both theoretical and computational linguistics. 

Topics include but are not limited to: morphology, phonology, 

syntax, semantics, pragmatics, discourse analysis, typology, corpus 

linguistics, formal grammar theory, language acquisition and 

language learning, human and machine language processing, language 

resources and language technology and possible applications of those 

research areas. Papers exemplifying synergy of multi-disciplinary 

approaches on the construction of language resources and system 

development that would assist language learning are particularly 

encouraged. Among the various research topics that may be addressed, 

one or more of the following issues may be included, to further 

mutual advancement among studies on language, information and 

computation: 



* How formal linguistic analyses can and has informed language 

technology in advancing the development of language processing 

applications. 



* What light theoretical linguistics has shed on the information 

demand of natural language processing, and how it has led to 

large-scale machine-usable language resources. 



* How collections of learner language resources may improve learning, 

teaching and testing of native and non-native languages. 



* What insights cognitive science, psycholinguistic research and brain 

imaging technology have brought about regarding the nature of 

language and language learning / acquisition. 



* What is the limit of pure computational methods like machine 

learning in language processing? What roles do related disciplines 

such as cognitive science and psycholinguistics have to play in 

bridging the gap between human and computer language processing? 



* How multilingual data and multilingual speakers can inform our 

analysis of language, from both the theoretical and practical points 

of view. 



Submissions should describe substantial, original, and unpublished 

work. Papers should be written in readable and plain English and may 

not exceed ten (10) pages, including references. Submissions 

will be judged based on reviewer scores for relevance to the 

conference, clarity and readability, originality of approach 

proposed, technical and theoretical soundness, adequacy of reference 

and discussion of previous study, and interest to the attendees. 

Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee 

members and/or additional reviewers. As the reviewing process will 

be anonymous, manuscripts must not include the authors' names and 

affiliations and authors should be careful not to reveal their 

identities in the paper. Papers that do not conform to these 

requirements may be rejected without review. 



Accepted papers will be presented in one of the regular sessions or 

interactive & poster sessions as determined by the program 

committee. Such decisions will be based on the nature rather than on 

the quality of the work submitted. Accepted papers will be published 

in the conference proceedings volume, which will subsequently be 

digitally archived and also sent to ISI/Thomson Reuters for 

indexing. Please refer to the PACLIC Steering Committee web site for 

details. 



Papers should be submitted electronically via EasyChair at 

The deadline for paper submissions has been extended to July 9, 2012. 

https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=paclic26. Submission 

instructions for authors and manuscript templates are available from 

the conference website.

Paper submission: https://www.softconf.com/lrec2012/Less-RessourcedLang2012/



Papers are invited for the above full-day workshop, in the format outlined below. Most submitted papers will be presented in poster form, though some authors may be invited to present in lecture format.



CONTEXT AND FOCUS



The 8th International Workshop of the ISCA Special Interest Group on Speech and Language Technology for Minority Languages (SALTMIL, http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/saltmil) and the 4th Workshop on African Language Technology (AfLaT2012) will be held as a joint effort in Istanbul, in May 2012, as part of the 2012 International Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC 2012).



Entitled ""Language technology for normalisation of less-resourced languages"", the workshop is intended to continue the series of SALTMIL/LREC workshops on computational language resources for minority languages, held in Granada (1998), Athens (2000), Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (2002) and Lisbon (2004), Genoa (2006), Marrakech (2008) and Malta (2010) and the series of AfLaT workshops, held in Athens (EACL2009), Malta (LREC2010) and Addis Ababa (AGIS11).



The Istanbul 2012 workshop aims to share information on tools and best practices, so that isolated researchers will not need to start from scratch. An important aspect will be the forming of personal contacts, which can minimize duplication of effort. There will be a balance between presentations of existing language resources, and more general presentations designed to give background information needed by all researchers.



While less-resourced languages and minority languages often struggle to find their place in a digital world dominated by only a handful of commercially interesting languages, a growing number of researchers are working on alleviating this linguistic digital divide, through localisation efforts, the development of BLARKs (basic language resource kits) and practical applications of human language technologies. The joint SALTMIL/AfLaT workshop on ""Language technology for normalisation of less-resourced languages"" provides a unique opportunity to connect these researchers and set up a common forum to meet and share the latest developments in the field.



TOPICS



The workshop takes an inclusive approach to the word “normalisation”, considering it to include both technologies that help make languages more “normal” in society and everyday life, as well as technologies that normalise languages, i.e. help create or maintain a written standard or support diversity in standards. We particularly focus on the challenges less-resourced and minority languages face in the digital world. Papers are invited that describe research and development in the following areas in the area of technologies for language normalisation, including (but not limited to) topics such as:

* Keyboard layouts and entry methods

* Standardisation in machine readable lexicons/dictionaries

* Computer-aided language learning (CALL)

* Dealing with language variants in NLP

* Automatic identification of varieties, dialects

* Corpus construction and annotation

* Terminology development and management

* MT between varieties of the same language

* Spelling correction/normalisation

* Machine translation (MT)

* Morphological analysers

* Part-of-speech taggers and parsers

* Speech recognition and synthesis

* Information extraction/retrieval

* Localisation efforts

* Mobile phones as a platform for HLT

1 PRESENTATION OF THE FIELD / THEMES TARGETED

The way we look at lexical units, their organization and use has changed dramatically in recent decades. Described in dictionaries and considered as annexes to grammar in the 1980s, they are now considered as raw material in NLP. If at the time we still used terms like 'words' or 'dictionaries', today we speak rather of 'lexical resources' of which there are a certain number (WordNet, FrameNet, VerbNet, PropBank, ...). These resources have been standardized (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBY-LMF), linked together (http://verbs.colorado.edu/semlink/) or linked to encyclopedias like Wikipedia (http: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BabelNet). There are also projects like DBnary (http://kaiko.getalp.org/about-dbnary) which, starting from Wiktionary,

The first attempts to automatically create resources from printed dictionaries (Ide & Véronis, sites.univ-provence.fr/veronis/publis.html) quickly encountered problems, due to the poor source: paper dictionaries did not contain the necessary information for subsequent use by the machine. However, that was precisely the desired goal. Access to vast corpora then made it possible to mark a turning point and build richer, more explicit and better structured resources. On this last point, WordNet (WN) played a key role. Although it has not had the expected success with psycholinguists or with users consulting the resource (to search for words), WN has had considerable success in NLP. Having said that, WN has also had an undeniable impact on the theoretical level. It has profoundly changed our way of seeing the structure of lexical resources. From now on, they are no longer reduced to simple alphabetical lists, but rather they are represented in the form of graphs (lexical network) whose nodes are lexical units linked by different types of relations.

At the same time as the evolution of lexical resources, one could observe a notable evolution concerning the work on graphs. The latter seem to lend themselves wonderfully to the modeling of various domains (Barrat, 2008, Barabási, 2003), including that of language. Indeed, there have been many works showing their relevance for capturing the meaning of words and sentences (Widdows, 2004; Sowa, 1991) or for modeling various aspects of the lexical 'world': associative structures (http: // www.eat.rl.ac.uk, or http://w3.usf.edu/FreeAssociation/), dictionary structure (Gaume et al. 2008), lexical density, average distance between words (Vitevitch, 2008), accessibility (Ferrer i Cancho & Sole, 2001), dynamic aspects of graphs (Dion, 2012), etc. 

We therefore note that there are two communities, one of which is interested in data (concrete like lexical units), and the other rather in their representation and organization (graphs, topology, navigation). It is to encourage the exchange of ideas between these two worlds that we are organizing this workshop.

2 THEMES
 
We are awaiting submissions on the themes mentioned above and in particular:
 


• Origin of data allowing the construction of resources: corpus (web, blogs, emails), human beings (list of associations), etc. ;

• Resource construction method: automatic, semi-automatic, collaborative (through games, etc.);

• Automatic network construction (identification and characterization of semantic relationships);

• Data structuring: alphabetical, thematic, semantic links, associative links;

• Mathematical properties of lexical networks;

• Factors affecting the weight of nodes or links: dynamic aspects of graphs (frequency, salience, recency, change of theme, etc.);

• Topological characterization of the lexical graph: distribution, relative density, evolution of the graph;

• Exploitation or use of the resource or one of its transformations such as the transformation of the graph into a tree to assist navigation (lexical access);

• Accessibility of words thanks to network characteristics (“small world” phenomenon);

• Visualization and manipulation of graphs (tree translation, clustering, semantic similarity calculation);

• Modeling of linguistic variations and language changes (evolution of the lexicon).



3 SELECTION CRITERIA
 
Submissions will be reviewed by at least two subject matter experts.



For the research work, the following will be considered in particular:
 
- the relevance to the themes of the workshop,
 
- the importance and originality of the contribution,
 
- the correctness of the scientific and technical content,
 
- the organization and clarity of the presentation.



4 SUBMISSION CONDITIONS

The articles will be written in French for French speakers, in English for those who do not speak French. They should follow the format of TALN 2014 and should not exceed 10 pages (including references). Style sheets (LaTeX and Word) are available on the conference website (http://www.taln2014.org/site/soumission/).

We accept long and short papers as well as tutorial proposals working on the following languages: Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian, Võro, the Sámi languages, Komi (Zyrian, Permyak), Mordvin (Erzya, Moksha), Mari (Hill, Meadow), Udmurt, Nenets (Tundra, Forest), Enets, Nganasan, Selkup, Mansi, Khanty, Veps, Karelian (Olonets), Karelian, Ingrian (Izhorian), Votic, Livonian, Ludic, and other related languages. All Uralic languages exhibit rich morphological structure, which makes processing them challenging for state-of-the-art computational linguistic approaches, the majority also suffer from a lack of resources and many are endangered. Research papers should be original, substantial and unpublished research, that can describe work-in-progress systems, frameworks, standards and evaluation schemes. Demos and tutorials will present systems and standards towards the goal of interoperability and unification of different projects, applications and research groups Appropriate topics include (but are not limited to):



Parsers, analysers and processing pipelines of Uralic languages

Lexical databases, electronic dictionaries

Finished end-user applications aimed at Uralic languages, such as spelling or grammar checkers, machine translation or speech processing

Evaluation methods and gold standards, tagged corpora, treebanks

Reports on language-independent or unsupervised methods as applied to Uralic languages

Surveys and review articles on subjects related to computational linguistics for one or more Uralic languages

Any work that aims at combining efforts and reducing duplication of work

How to elicit activity from the language community, agitation campaigns, games with a purpose



To maximise the possibility of reproducibility, replication and reuse, we particularly encourage submissions which present free/open-source language resources and make use of free/open-source software. One of the aims of this gathering is to avoid unnecessary duplicated work in field of Uralistics by establishing connections and interoperability standards between researchers and research groups working at different sites. We have also identified a serious lack of gold standards and evaluation metrics for all Uralic languages including those with national support, any work towards better resources in these fields will be greatly appreciated."

Special Issue on Textual Entailment 



Call For Papers 



The goal of identifying textual entailment - whether one piece of text can be plausibly inferred from another - has emerged in recent years as a generic core problem in Natural Language Understanding. For instance, in order to answer the question 'Who killed Kennedy?', a QA system may need to recognize that 'Oswald killed Kennedy' can be inferred from 'the assassination of Kennedy by Oswald'. Work in this area has been largely driven by the PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) challenges, a series of annual competitive meetings (http://www.pascal-network.org/Challenges/RTE3). This work exhibits strong ties to some earlier lines of research, particularly automatic acquisition of paraphrases and lexical semantic relationships, and unsupervised inference in applications such as question answering, information extraction and summarization. It has also opened the way to newer lines of research on more involved inference methods, on knowledge representations needed to support this natural language understanding challenge and on the use of learning methods in this context. RTE has fostered an active and growing community of researchers focused on the problem of applied entailment. 



The special issue of JNLE will provide an opportunity to showcase some of the most important work in this emerging area. Articles for this special issue are invited on all aspects of textual entailment, aiming at a broader scope than exhibited within the RTE challenges. Topics include, but are not limited to: *Representation levels, such as -Lexical, n-gram, and substring overlap -Linguistic annotations (POS tags, syntactic structure, semantic dependencies) *Utilizing background knowledge, e.g. inference rules, paraphrase templates, lexical relations *Knowledge acquisition methods - From corpora/Web, including acquiring entailment/paraphrasing corpora - From semantic resources like FrameNet, PropBank, VerbNet, NOMLEX/NOMBANK *Inference mechanisms, such as - Similarity/subsumption metrics - Tree-based distances and transformations - Machine learning - Logical inference using theorem provers 



*The impact of entailment capabilities on applications *Evaluation methods *Data analysis Submission information: Please consult the journal web site for instructions for contributors (http://uk.cambridge.org/journals/nle/).

The Third International Workshop on Systems and Frameworks

for Computational Morphology (SFCM 2013)



http://sfcm.eu/sfcm2013/



Workshop date: September 6, 2013



Location: Humboldt-Universität, Berlin, Germany



Submission deadline: March 15, 2013



*********************************************************************



The Workshop on Systems and Frameworks for Computational Morphology

(SFCM) aims to bring together researchers and developers in the area

of computational morphology.  The focus of SFCM are actual, working

systems and frameworks based on linguistic principles and providing

linguistically motivated analyses and/or generation on the basis of

linguistic categories.



In 2013, SFCM will take place for the third time.  This edition of the

workshop will focus on the role of morphological analysis and

generation to improve the rather disappointing situation with respect

to language technology for languages other than English.  We aim to

encourage discussion among researchers and developers and to provide

an up-to-date overview of available systems and frameworks for

computational morphology.



From the point of view of computational linguistics, morphological

resources form the basis for all higher-level applications.  This is

especially true for languages with a rich morphology like German,

Finnish, or Polish.  A morphology component should thus be capable of

analyzing single wordforms as well as whole corpora.  For many

practical applications, not only morphological analysis, but also

generation is required, i.e., the production of surfaces corresponding

to specific categories.



Apart from uses in computational linguistics, there are numerous

practical applications that can benefit from morphological analysis

and/or generation or even require it, for example in text processing,

user interfaces, or information retrieval.  These applications have

specific requirements for morphological components, including

requirements from software engineering, such as programming interfaces

or robustness.



We are in the process of arranging the publication of the proceedings

with Springer-Verlag in their CCIS series (as for the previous two

editions of SFCM).



The workshop has three main goals:



    * To stimulate discussion among researchers and developers and to

      offer an up-to-date overview of available morphological systems

      for specific purposes.

    * To stimulate discussion among developers of general frameworks

      that can be used to implement morphological components for

      several languages.

    * To discuss aspects of evaluation of morphology systems and

      possible future competitions or tasks.



SFCM is an activity of the SIG Generation and Parsing of the German

Society for Computational Linguistics and Language Technology (GSCL).





*Topics*



The topics of this workshop include technical aspects, applications,

and uses of systems and frameworks for computational morphology.

While purely theoretical submissions may be relevant, the focus of the

workshop is clearly on actual, working systems and prototypes.



This edition of the workshop will focus on the role of morphological

analysis and generation to improve the rather disappointing situation

with respect to language technology for languages other than English.



However, we also welcome submissions on other topics relevant to the

general topic of the workshop, i.e., systems and frameworks for

computational morphology.



Topics include, but are not limited to:



    * Frameworks for developing morphological components.

    * Open-source tools and resources for morphology.

    * Descriptions of systems for analyzing and generating word forms.

    * Morphological components for interactive use.

    * Approaches for handling phenomena at the interface between

      morphology and syntax.

    * Use cases for morphological analysis and generation in applications.

    * Reports on actual uses of morphological analysis and generation

      in applications.

    * Methods and criteria for evaluating morphologic components with

      respect to performance, quality, and coverage.

    * Software engineering aspects: APIs, robustness, performance,

      hardware/software requirements, resource usage.

    * License models and legal aspects.



There will be opportunities for demonstrating systems.





*Submissions*



We invite researchers to submit full papers of up to 20 pages

(including references) or short papers of up to 10 pages.  Long papers

constitute an excellent opportunity to publish citable, in-depth

descriptions of systems and frameworks.  Submissions must be in

English.  Reviewing of papers will be double-blind by the members of

the program committee, and all submissions will receive several

independent reviews.  Papers submitted at review stage must not

contain the authors' names, affiliations, or any information that may

disclose the authors' identity.



Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their research

at the workshop as talk or as a poster.  Accepted papers will be

published in the proceedings of the workshop.



The papers must use the Springer-Verlag LNCS format.  We recommend to

use the LaTeX2e class.  Please strictly follow the LNCS guidelines.

Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format.  For paper

submissions we use EasyChair, see

SHARED TASK DESCRIPTION



This shared task proposes data to experiment on causality detection, and focuses on determining causality associated to an event or to transformations of financial objects.

The data are extracted from a corpus of 2019 financial news provided by QWAM http://www.qwamci.com/.

______________________________________________________________________



SUBTASKS



The task contains two subtasks:

a) Sentence classification

This task is a binary classification task. The goal of this subtask is to filter sentences which display causal meanings (1) from the sentences that are noise in regard of causality (0)

b) Cause – effect detection

This task is a relation extraction task. The aim is to identify, in a text block defined as causal (causal sentence or paragraph), the substring displaying the cause and the substring describing the effect.

ACL 2016 Workshop on

Cognitive Aspects of Computational Language Learning (CogACLL)



                August 11, 2016

                Berlin, Germany 



     http://sites.google.com/site/cognitivews2016



Deadline for Long and Short Paper Submissions: May 8, 2016 (11:59pm GMT -12)

Deadline for System Demonstrations: May 29, 2016  (11:59pm GMT -12)   



This workshop is endorsed by SIGNLL, the Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

---------------------------------------------------------------



The human ability to acquire and process language has long attracted interest and generated much debate due to the apparent ease with which such a complex and dynamic system is learnt and used on the face of ambiguity, noise and uncertainty. This subject raises many questions ranging from the nature vs. nurture debate of how much needs to be innate and how much needs to be learned for acquisition to be successful, to the mechanisms involved in this process (general vs specific) and their representations in the human brain. There are also developmental issues related to the different stages consistently found during acquisition (e.g. one word vs. two words) and possible organizations of this knowledge. These have been discussed in the context of first and second language acquisition and bilingualism, with crosslinguistic studies shedding light on the influence of the language and the environment.



The past decades have seen a massive expansion in the application of statistical and machine learning methods to natural language processing (NLP). This work has yielded impressive results in numerous speech and language processing tasks, including e.g. speech recognition, morphological analysis, parsing, lexical acquisition, semantic interpretation, and dialogue management. The good results have generally been viewed as engineering achievements. Recently researchers have begun to investigate the relevance of computational learning methods for research on human language acquisition and change.



The use of computational modeling is a relatively recent trend boosted by advances in machine learning techniques, and the availability of resources like corpora of child and child-directed sentences, and data from psycholinguistic tasks by normal and pathological groups. Many of the existing computational models attempt to study language tasks under cognitively plausible criteria (such as memory and processing limitations that humans face), and to explain the developmental stages observed in the acquisition and evolution of the language abilities. In doing so, computational modeling provides insight into the plausible mechanisms involved in human language processes, and inspires the development of better language models and techniques. These investigations are very important since if computational techniques can be used to improve our understanding of human language acquisition and change, these will not only benefit cognitive sciences in general but will reflect back to NLP and place us in a better position to develop useful language models.



Success in this type of research requires close collaboration between the NLP, linguistics, psychology and cognitive science communities. The workshop is targeted at anyone interested in the relevance of computational techniques for understanding first, second and bilingual language acquisition and language change in normal and clinical conditions. Long and short papers are invited on, but not limited to, the following topics:



*Computational learning theory and analysis of language learning and organization

*Computational models of first, second and bilingual language acquisition

*Computational models of language changes in clinical conditions

*Computational models and analysis of factors that influence language acquisition and use in different age groups and cultures

*Computational models of various aspects of language and their interaction effect in acquisition, processing and change

*Computational models of the evolution of language

*Data resources and tools for investigating computational models of human language processes

*Empirical and theoretical comparisons of the learning environment and its impact on language processes

*Cognitively oriented Bayesian models of language processes

*Computational methods for acquiring various linguistic information (related to e.g. speech, morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, and discourse) and their relevance to research on human language acquisition

*Investigations and comparisons of supervised, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods for learning (e.g. machine learning, statistical, symbolic, biologically-inspired, active learning, various hybrid models) from a cognitive perspective



---------------------------------------------------------------

SUBMISSIONS



We invite three different submission modalities:



* Regular long papers (8 content pages + 1 page for references):

  Long papers should report on original, solid and finished research

  including new experimental results, resources and/or techniques.



* Regular short papers (4 content pages + 1 page for references):

  Short papers should report on small experiments, focused contributions,

  ongoing research, negative results and/or philosophical discussion.



* System demonstration (2 pages): System demonstration papers should

  describe and document the demonstrated system or resources. We

  encourage the demonstration of both early research prototypes and

  mature systems, that will be presented in a separate demo session.



All submissions must be in PDF format and must follow the ACL 2016 

formatting requirements.



We strongly advise the use of the provided Word or LaTeX template

files. For long and short papers, the reported research should

be substantially original. The papers will be presented orally or as

posters. The decision as to which paper will be presented orally

and which as poster will be made by the program committee based

on the nature rather than on the quality of the work.



Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information

should be included in the papers; self-reference should be

avoided as well. Papers that do not conform to these requirements

will be rejected without review. Accepted papers will appear in the

workshop proceedings, where no distinction will be made between

papers presented orally or as posters.



Submission and reviewing will be electronic, managed by the START system:



    https://www.softconf.com/acl2016/CogACLL/

   



Submissions must be uploaded onto the START system by the submission deadline:



    May 8, 2016 (11:59pm GMT -12 hours)



Please choose the appropriate submission type from the START 

submission page, according to the category of your paper.

Submission information:



Full papers:

Short papers:

Demos:



Full papers: Submissions must describe original, completed, unpublished work. Each submission will be judged chiefly on the strength of the argument it provides in support of its contribution, through e.g., experimental evaluation, theoretical analysis, or critical engagement with HLT. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.



Accepted full papers will be given eight pages in the proceedings, and may be presented either as a poster or an oral presentation.  Some research is best suited to a traditional oral presentation, whereas other research would benefit from the more interactive presentation a poster allows.  As an experiment this year, long paper presenters can express a preference to deliver their paper as a poster or an oral presentation. The program and area chairs will attempt to fulfill as many of these preferences as possible, organizational factors permitting. ACL 08: HLT will additionally aim to give poster presentations higher status than usual (by scheduling, physical arrangement, combination with refreshments). The proceedings will not distinguish long papers by presentation format.



The deadline for full papers is January 10, 2008.  Submission will be electronic using the paper submission software available at https://www.softconf.com/acl08/papers.



                                                 back to top



Short papers: In keeping with the HLT tradition, ACL 08: HLT solicits short papers as well as long papers. The short paper deadline is just three months before the conference to allow authors to bring fresh research and new ideas to the conference. Papers qualifying as short papers can be of one of three types:



  - late-breaking results,

  - smaller-scale work than a long paper, e.g., a new idea or

    a system without a full evaluation,

  - opinion or position papers.



Short papers will be presented in one or more poster sessions, and will be given four pages in the proceedings.  Short papers will be distinguished from full papers in the proceedings.  Each short paper submission will be reviewed by at least two program committee members. The deadline for short papers is March 14, 2008.  Submission will be electronic using the paper submission software available at https://www.softconf.com/acl08/papers.



                                                 back to top



Format:



 Full paper submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL 08: HLT proceedings without exceeding eight (8) pages, including references.  Short paper submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings, and should not exceed four (4) pages, including references.  As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., ""We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."", should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ""Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."". Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.  All submissions must be electronic in PDF.  Please see the conference website for detailed typesetting specifications. Authors are strongly encouraged to use the LaTeX or Microsoft Word style files available on the conference website.



Demonstration, doctoral consortium, student sessions, tutorial, and workshop

proposals:



Multiple-submission policy: Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must provide this information at submission time. If ACL08: HLT accepts a paper, authors must notify the program chairs by March 7, 2008 (full papers) or April 21, 2008 (short papers), indicating which meeting they choose for presentation of their work.  ACL08: HLT cannot accept for publication or presentation work that will be (or has been) published elsewhere.  For the short paper submissions to ACL08: HLT, a paper will be considered identical to a long paper (for example, an eight-page paper submitted to ACL) if it does not differ in at least two content pages from the long paper.

**NEW DEVELOPMENTS FOR THE SECOND CFP (ACL2020)**



We have several exciting and important developments in the ACL2020 conference that we want to highlight at the top of the second call for papers:



1) Reviewer and Author Profile Signup

2) Paper Templates

3) Theme

4) Dual Submission 

5) Publication Date





1) Special Instructions for Reviewer and Author Signup

As our field has grown considerably over the last five years, it is important that our reviewing process scales accordingly.  For the ACL2020 conference, we are creating a new review process with a goal to better manage conflict of interest (COI) and better match submissions with appropriate reviewers.  The big picture is that authors and reviewers must create or update a Global Profile and fill out the ACL2020 Reviewer/Author Information Form.  



Global Profile:  please fill out this form in order to compute conflicts of interest and better match papers with appropriate reviewers.  

https://www.softconf.com/acl2020/super/scmd.cgi?ucmd=updateProfile



ACL2020 Reviewer/Author Information Form: this allows us to better match papers with the best reviewers:

https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=9028kaqAQ0OMdrEjlJf7WV1_1tZ1K-JCmL49YyhKe89UQTczV0xMNVhZSzhaWjVaNzJIS0U2MzNXUy4u 



A blog post including more detailed instructions and commonly asked questions will be found here:  https://acl2020.org/blog/author-reviewer-profile/





2) Paper Submission and Templates:  Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system.  The submission site is now available at: https://www.softconf.com/acl2020/papers/



Both long and short papers must follow the ACL Author Guidelines:

https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Author_Guidelines

Style sheets (Latex, Word) are available here: http://acl2020.org/downloads/acl2020-templates.zip  



And the Overleaf template is also available here: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acl-2020-proceedings-template/zsrkcwjptpcd





3) Theme: As 2020 quickly approaches, we felt this was a great time to reflect on the state of the field of NLP, as well its future, with a special Theme track.  We hope you consider submitting a paper!  You can find details here:  https://acl2020.org/blog/theme/





4) Archival and Dual Submissions can be a bit tricky.  We outline what is acceptable and what isn’t on this blog:  https://acl2020.org/blog/arxiv-papers-double-submissions/  





5) Publication Date:   The official publication date is June 19, 2020, just over two weeks before the conference begins.  On this date the proceedings are made available in the ACL Anthology, and will be indicated as such in the ACL Anthology bibliographic records.  The official publication date may affect the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACL Anthology after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)





**CALL FOR PAPERS - MAIN CONFERENCE**



The 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2020) invites the submission of long and short papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing.

ACL 2020 Theme: Taking Stock of Where We’ve Been and Where We’re Going



The last few years have witnessed an unprecedented growth in NLP since the field began over sixty years ago.  The availability of large amounts of data and computing resources have led to new models and representations and exciting results on many NLP benchmark tasks. SOTA systems have approached human performance on several benchmark tasks.  As we embrace these new exciting results and advances, ACL 2020 is particularly interested in papers that can provide insights for the community to assess how much we have accomplished in developing a machine’s ability in understanding and generating human language and how far we are pushing the boundaries as a field given the long history of NLP research.  



Potential submissions of interest include (but not limited to) position papers, empirical/theoretical papers that: 



Reflect on the progress of the field or a sub-topic area from a larger spectrum and make connections and/or comparisons between the past and the present to provide a holistic view on where we stand today with respect to the past;

Examine, analyze, and interpret SOTA models and results to shed light on limitations as well as key advances that may have lasting impact;  

Bring novel ideas for advancing the field, e.g., to enable and measure machine’s ability in language processing beyond laboratory benchmarks; 



We anticipate to have a special session for this theme at the conference and a best Thematic Paper Award in addition to the traditional Best Paper Awards.

PAPER SUBMISSION INFORMATION



Long Papers



Long paper submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Review forms will be made available prior to the deadlines.



Long papers may consist of up to 8 pages of content, plus unlimited references; final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.



Long papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and which as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings between long papers presented orally and as posters.





Short Papers



Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages. Some kinds of short papers are:



-A small, focused contribution

-A negative result

-An opinion piece

-An interesting application nugget



Short papers may consist of up to 4 pages of content, plus unlimited references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given 5 content pages in the proceedings. Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address reviewers' comments in their final versions.



Short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers presented orally and as posters.





IMPORTANT: Anonymity Period



The following rules and guidelines are meant to protect the integrity of double-blind review and ensure that submissions are reviewed fairly. The rules make reference to the anonymity period, which runs from 1 month before the submission deadline (starting November 9, 2019 11:59PM UTC-12:00) up to the date when your paper is either accepted, rejected, or withdrawn (April 3, 2020).



You may not make a non-anonymized version of your paper available online to the general community (for example, via a preprint server) during the anonymity period. By a version of a paper we understand another paper having essentially the same scientific content but possibly differing in minor details (including title and structure) and/or in length (e.g., an abstract is a version of the paper that it summarizes).



If you have posted a non-anonymized version of your paper online before the start of the anonymity period, you may submit an anonymized version to the conference. The submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version, and you must inform the program chair(s) that a non-anonymized version exists. 



You may not update the non-anonymized version during the anonymity period, and we ask you not to advertise it on social media or take other actions that would further compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period.



Note that, while you are not prohibited from making a non-anonymous version available online before the start of the anonymity period, this does make double-blind reviewing more difficult to maintain, and we therefore encourage you to wait until the end of the anonymity period if possible. Alternatively, you may consider submitting your work to the Computational Linguistics journal, which does not require anonymization and has a track for ""short"" (i.e., conference-length) papers.





Instructions for Double-Blind Review



As reviewing will be double blind, papers must not include authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references or links (such as github) that reveal the author's identity, e.g., ""We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."" must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ""Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."" Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.



Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents that are not available to the reviewers. For example, do not omit or redact important citation information to preserve anonymity. Instead, use third person or named reference to this work, as described above (“Smith showed” rather than “we showed”).



Papers may be accompanied by a resource (software and/or data) described in the paper, but these resources should be anonymized as well. 





Authorship



The author list for submissions should include all (and only) individuals who made substantial contributions to the work presented. Each author listed on a submission to ACL 2020 will be notified of submissions, revisions and the final decision. No changes to the order or composition of authorship may be made to submissions to ACL 2020 after the paper submission deadline.





Citation and Comparison



You are expected to cite all refereed publications relevant to your submission, but you may be excused for not knowing about all unpublished work (especially work that has been recently posted and/or is not widely cited).



In cases where a preprint has been superseded by a refereed publication, the refereed publication should be cited instead of the preprint version.



Papers (whether refereed or not) appearing less than 3 months before the submission deadline are considered contemporaneous to your submission, and you are therefore not obliged to make detailed comparisons that require additional experimentation and/or in-depth analysis.



For more information, see the ACL Policies for Submission, Review, and Citation: https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/new-policies-submission-review-and-citation





Multiple Submission Policy



Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time in the START submission form, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted by ACL 2020. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at ACL 2020 must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper will be presented. We will not accept for publication or presentation the papers that overlap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere.



Authors submitting more than one paper to ACL 2020 must ensure that submissions do not overlap significantly ()25%) with each other in content or results.





Paper Submission and Templates



Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system.  The submission site is now available at https://www.softconf.com/acl2020/papers/



Both long and short papers must follow the ACL Author Guidelines:

https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Author_Guidelines



Style sheets (Latex, Word) are available here.

http://acl2020.org/downloads/acl2020-templates.zip  



The Overleaf template is also available here. https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acl-2020-proceedings-template/zsrkcwjptpcd



Please do not modify these style files, or use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.





Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data



Each ACL 2020 submission can be accompanied by a single PDF appendix, one .tgz or .zip archive containing software, and one .tgz or .zip archive containing data. ACL 2020 encourages the submission of these supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results, and to enable authors to provide additional information that does not fit in the paper. For example, preprocessing decisions, model parameters, feature templates, lengthy proofs or derivations, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of the work described in the paper can be put into the appendix. However, the paper submissions need to remain fully self-contained, as these supplementary materials are completely optional, and reviewers are not even asked to review or download them. If the pseudo-code or derivations or model specifications are an important part of the contribution, or if they are important for the reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work, they should be a part of the main paper, and not appear in the appendix. Supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.





PRESENTATION REQUIREMENT 



All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at ACL 2020 must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline if they wish to withdraw the paper.



Previous presentations of the work (e.g. preprints on arXiv.org) should be indicated in a footnote in the final version of papers appearing in the ACL 2020 proceedings.  Please note that this footnote should not be in the submission version of the paper.



At least one author of each accepted paper must register for ACL 2020 by the early registration deadline.





FURTHER INFORMATION



The conference website will be continually updated with information on workshops, tutorials, venue, traveling, etc.

REQUIREMENTS



Papers should describe original work; they should emphasize completed

work or -- in the case of posters -- ongoing research rather than

intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion of

the reported results. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation

results should be included. Submissions will be judged on

correctness, originality, technical strength, significance and

relevance to the conference, and interest to the attendees.



Submissions presented at the conference should mostly contain new

material that has not been presented at any other meeting with

publicly available proceedings. Papers that are being submitted in

parallel to other conferences or workshops must indicate this on the

title page, as must papers that contain significant overlap with

previously published work.



 

REVIEWING



Reviewing will be managed by an international Conference Program

Committee consisting of Area Chairs and associated Program Committee

Members.



Area Chairs:



    Paul Buitelaar (DFKI, Germany)



    Robert Dale (Macquarie University, Australia)



    Mary Dalrymple (University of Oxford, UK)



    Bill Dolan (Microsoft Research, USA)



    Eva Hajicova (Charles University, Czech Republic)



    Julia Hirschberg (Columbia University, USA)



    Chu-Ren Huang (Academia Sinica, Taiwan)



    Pierre Isabelle (NRC Institute for Information Technology, Canada)



    Mark Johnson (Brown University, USA)



    Miles Osborne (University of Edinburgh, UK)



    Stephen Pulman (University of Oxford, UK)



    Dan Roth (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA)



    Junichi Tsujii (University of Tokyo, Japan)



    Yorick Wilks (University of Sheffield, UK)



 

The reviewing process will be blind and each submission will be

reviewed by at least three program committee members.



 

CATEGORIES OF PAPERS



Papers can be submitted to one of two categories: the REGULAR PAPER

category or the POSTER category. Authors must designate one of these

categories at submission time. Although both categories of submission

will be the same maximum length, regular papers will be presented

a single time to a potentially large audience during one of the

parallel paper sessions at the conference, and poster presentations

will be repeated several times before small groups of people (using

paper posters) at one of the conference poster sessions. Regular

papers are most appropriate for presenting substantial research

results, while posters are more appropriate for presenting an ongoing

research effort. Regular papers and poster papers will appear

in separate volumes of the proceedings.



 SUBMISSION INFORMATION



 Submission will be electronic. The only accepted format for submitted

papers is Adobe PDF. The papers must be submitted no later than 30th

March 2008. Papers submitted after that time will not be reviewed.



Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings

and should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We

strongly recommend the use of the LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word

document template that will be made available on the conference Web

site. A description of the required format will be made available to

those who are unable to make direct use of these style files. We

reserve the right to reject submissions that do not conform to these

styles, including font size restrictions.



As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors'

names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the

author's identity, e.g., ""We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."",

should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ""Smith previously

showed (Smith, 1991) ..."". Papers that do not conform to these

requirements will be rejected without review.



For details of the submission procedure, please consult the

submission web page reachable via the conference website at

www.coling2008.org.uk.

CONFERENCE VENUE



Manchester is the largest city and urban area of Northern England.

The City of Manchester itself has a population of 452,000. But with a

population of more than 2,2 Million, the Manchester metropolitan area

is the second largest urban zone in the UK and the fourteenth most

populated in Europe. Manchester's international airport is a major

international hub with 220 direct destinations, more than offered by

Heathrow or Gatwick.



The city gained global fame as one of the capitals of the Industrial

Revolution.  Today Manchester is a city in transformation. The dark

satanic mills of Lowry's paintings belong to the 19th and 20th

centuries. Twenty-first century Manchester is a city of canalside

restaurants and cafes, famous for its cultural and sporting activity

as much as its business, science and education. Easily accessible by

road, rail and air, and easy to get around once you're here,

Manchester has become one of the world's most attractive, exciting

and vibrant cities, with great attractions, friendly people, and a

decent climate with -- contrary to popular belief -- about the same

rainfall as any other British city.



The city has undergone massive refurbishment in recent years, and

offers a superb range of accommodation, shopping, recreation and

dining possibilities, including the UK's second-biggest Chinatown,

the world-famous curry mile, with restaurants serving cuisine from

more than 30 different cultures, and more entries in the Good Food

Guide than any other city outside London.



COLING 2008 will take place at the brand new University Place, a

purpose-built conferences centre, one of several stunning buildings

recently built as part of the university's expansion following the

merger of UMIST and the Victoria University of Manchester, making it

the biggest university in Britain.



As a birthplace of modern computing, and one of the pioneers in

computational linguistics in the UK, Manchester is delighted to host

the first COLING to be held in this country and looks forward to

welcoming you in August 2008."

Since its first meeting at the end of 2009, the International Conference of Digital Archives and Digital Humanities (DADH) has utilized its yearly theme and programming agenda to collaboratively investigate ways to integrate modern information technology into the exploration of the traditional humanities field, and to furthermore exceed the limitations in humanities research put in place by more conventional data and topics. We have polished our scholarship over the past decade. As the Chinese idiom goes, “It takes ten years to sharpen a sword” – and we are ready to cut a path into new frontiers in the second decade of our endeavor. The Academia Sinica Center for Digital Cultures will be the host of the 11th International Conference of Digital Archives and Digital Humanities (DADH 2020). We hereby invite all scholars to join us in this great undertaking.



Facing the ascendance of digital humanities as a rapidly flourishing field, this year’s conference will continue examining the many aspects of research in digital humanities. In addition, the theme of this year’s conference will be “Smart Data ╳ Digital Humanities.” We call on scholars to pool their knowledge to explore how we can convert massive quantities of disparate data preserved in digital archives, by means of the latest technological developments in semantic web and artificial intelligence, to enable large databases to serve not only as data silos passively searched by researchers, but to go further and become able to actively respond to researchers’ queries and ideas, providing knowledge graphs that dynamically link people to answers. In short, structuring data to make it more usable.



Due to the ongoing uncertainty of the current global COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to gather for in-person discussion may be impacted. Therefore, this year’s conference will be carried out through live online video conferencing technology. We welcome all those who share an interest in the development of digital humanities research to partake in our mutual exchange of knowledge across the online cloud. Together, we will reflect on the many possibilities explored and yet to be explored on the future horizons of digital humanities.

Outline



The SPMRL series of workshop provides a forum for research in parsing

morphologically-rich languages, with the goal of identifying

cross-cutting issues in the annotation and parsing methodology for such

languages, which typically have more flexible word order and/or higher

word-form variation than English.





What we have learned



Past SPMRL installments have been host to successful identification of

some problem areas and approaches that address these problems: in the

presence of word order variation, more meaningful results can be reached

through treebank transformations (Versley & Rehbein 2009; Tsarfaty &

Sima'an 2010, Choi et al., 2012) or latent annotations (Petrov et al.,

2006), the parallel use of constituency and dependency structures (Le

Roux et al., 2012), as well as techniques to provide prior knowledge in

the handling of unseen words (Candito & Seddah 2010, Rehbein 2011,

Sigogne et al 2011; Anguiano & Candito 2012).



SPMRL has also been host to discussions on realistic and appropriate

evaluation methods that can be applied in the face of morphological

and/or segmentation ambiguities; these discussions have culminated in a

shared task for parsing these morphologically-rich languages, which will

be co-located with the workshop.





Areas of interest



The areas of interest of the fourth SPMRL workshop include, but are not

limited to, the following list of topics:



-   applying cutting-edge parsing techniques to new languages

-   strengths and weaknesses of current parsing techniques when applied to

    morphologically-rich languages

-   insights and techniques that are targeted at improving parsing quality for 

    morphologically-rich languages

-   using insights from parsing and associated processing problems to motivate 

    decisions in the creation of new syntactically annotated corpora

-   annotation and parsing of data from domains and genres that are not yet

    covered for many languages





How to Submit



Authors are invited to submit long papers (up to 9 pages + references)

and short papers (up to 5 pages + references). Long papers should

describe unpublished, substantial and completed research. Short papers

should be position papers, papers describing work in progress or short,

focused contributions.





Submissions will be accepted until July, 29 , 2013, (11:59 p.m. PST) in

PDF format via the START system (https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2013/SPMRL2013)

56th LINGUISTICS COLLOQUIUM



November 26 to 28, 2020



International conference comprising all fields of linguistics



For the first time taking place as a free online event



Special theme: Translation, Multilinguality and Cognition



Submission of abstracts (extended): October 12, 2020



Submission of full papers: February 28, 2021



Website: www.lingcoll.de (English and German)



Keynote speaker: Philipp Koehn, Johns Hopkins University, USA



=============================================================



Since its inception in 1966, the Linguistics Colloquium has been held annually without interruption in a total of 18 European countries. Its long term continuity is ensured by a large international committee consisting of its previous organizers. The Colloquium is devoted to research in all areas of linguistics. It is open to different theoretical approaches and aims to create friendly and inspiring conditions for the fruitful exchange of ideas and results. It is also appreciated for its welcoming atmosphere and cooperative discussion culture open to scientists of all ages and nationalities.



Traditionally, authors submit an abstract which, upon acceptance,  is presented and discussed at the conference. Afterwards, a full paper has to be submitted, taking into account the outcome of the scientific discussion. As usually, also this year we plan to publish the  proceedings as a hardcover book in the series ""Linguistik International"" of the Peter Lang publishing house.

Like many other conferences, this year, for the first time in its history, the Linguistics Colloquium will be organized as an online event. As, despite regular attendance from overseas, the Colloquium has been a mostly European event so far, we hope that colleagues from other continents will see this as an opportunity to get to know the friendly and co-operative spirit of the colloquium. To further encourage this and because an online event requires less funding, as a novelty this year we decided to completely waive registration fees.





TOPIC AREAS



The special theme of this year's conference is ""Translation, Multilinguality and Cognition"". But contributions from all areas of linguistics are welcome, including but not limited to:



* Theory of linguistics

* Historical linguistics

* Diachronic linguistics

* Corpus linguistics, text mining

* Computational linguistics, natural language processing

* Neural languague processing and machine learning

* Comparative & contrastive linguistics, typology

* Applied linguistics, language learning

* Neuro- and psycholinguistics

* Sociolinguistics

* Lexicology, lexicography

* Phonology, phonetics

* Morphology

4th Swiss Text Analytics Conference – SwissText 2019

====================================================



18-19 June 2019, Winterthur, Switzerland

www.swisstext.org



=================================

Call for Papers and Presentations

=================================



[for Call for Workshops, see below]



SwissText is an annual conference that brings together text analytics experts from industry and academia. The conference is held on June 18-19, 2019 in Winterthur, Switzerland, which is a short train ride (20min) from Zurich.



The conference will have three tracks:

- Swiss Track, with a strong focus on Swiss industry and research.

- Scientific Track, with technical research papers from the international community.

- Demo Track, with hands-on, interactive presentations of current NLP solutions.



The full scientific papers will be published in the conference proceedings, as well as the abstracts of the presentations of the Swiss and the Demo Track.





Swiss Track

===========

The goal of the Swiss Track is to bring together experts from Swiss industry and academia. For this track, we are looking for presentations with a certain ""Swissness"" factor:



- Your company or university is located in Switzerland;

- You provide a text analytics solution for one (or more) of the languages of Switzerland (including Swiss dialects);

- Your product focuses primarily on the Swiss market;

- Or any other factor that connects your presentation to Switzerland.



Presentations can be:

- Showcases

- Applications (If you have a demo, please submit to the Demo Track instead)

- Resources

- Research results

- Or any other contribution that is interesting to the audience.



In this track, we also welcome scientific contributions that were already published in other conferences or journals - as long as they have a Swissness factor.



For the Swiss Track, only a short abstract (up to 1500 characters) has to be submitted, along with a CV of the presenter (max 500 chars) and the intended audience (e.g. developers, decision makers, project managers, max. 300 chars). All data is entered online via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=swisstext2019



Note: If you intend to publish a novel, fully scientific paper with a Swiss-related topic, please submit it to the Scientific Track. If you would like to present mainly a demo of your solution, please submit to the Demo Track.





Scientific Track

================

SwissText has the goal to feature a profound technical program. We invite submissions of scientific papers in all areas in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computational Linguistics (CL), and Machine Learning/Data Science with a focus on Text Analytics.



Submission format:

- Please use the ACL LaTeX template: http://acl2017.org/downloads/acl17-latex.zip

- Up to 8 pages, excluding references

- Language: English

- Anonymize: The review process will be double blind; we ask authors to anonymize their submission reasonably. Instead of e.g. ""We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."", write ""Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...""

- Manuscripts must describe original work that has neither been published before, nor is currently under review elsewhere.

- Submission will be made through EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=swisstext2019 





Demo Track

==========

For the first time, SwissText will feature a dedicated track for demonstrations of working and available NLP solutions (open source and proprietary). The goal is to give developers, companies, and researchers a platform to showcase their products and tools, and for the audience to get an overview of production-ready NLP solutions. 



Please provide a short abstract of your demo (1500 characters) and a description of the intended audience (e.g. developers, researchers, etc., max. 300 chars). All data is entered online via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=swisstext2019





===========

Proceedings

===========



All accepted scientific papers will be published in full length in the conference proceedings. For presentations in the Swiss Track, the abstract will be included in the proceedings, as well as the abstracts of the Demo Track. There is no differentiation between oral or poster presentations in the proceedings. The proceedings shall be submitted to CEUR-WS.org for online publication under open access. To appear in the proceedings, each contribution has to be presented by at least one author at the conference.

Overview

------------



Internet users have become providers of information through social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and so forth. On the other side organisations may benefit by integrating social network analysis, for instance, to understand employee innovative behaviour, as, for instance, integrating social networks and the leader member exchange perspectives. Still, networks models show how information sharing, models of social cohesion and mutual goals (i.e. values) make organization social capital.  In this context Semantic Computing plays a chief role because of its potentiality to turn shapeless crowds information into social and digestible knowledge.

Furthermore, recent developments in processing, storing, and sharing huge amount of data become problematic due to the lack of new approaches, techniques, methods, algorithms and technologies oriented to social networks, including theoretical notions and insufficient awareness on security, retrieval, networking, behavioral and social issues.

The workshop, that will take place between Feb 3, 2020 - Feb 5, 2020, in conjunction with the 14th IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC2020), (http://www.ieee-icsc.org/) is a forum for researchers, industry practitioners and domain experts in the field of semantic computing, social networks, and social interactions and organisation sciences to exchange the latest advances in the state of the art and practice of semantic computing applications to the social network context.

=============================================================

Extended Deadline for Paper Submission: November 30, 2015

=============================================================

SCOPE



Computational and technological developments that incorporate natural language are proliferating. Adequate coverage encounters difficult problems related to partiality, underspecification, and context-dependency, which are signature features of information in nature and natural languages. Furthermore, agents (humans or computational systems) can participate in informational content, or influence its flow as information conveyors and interpreters.



The session covers theoretical work, advanced applications, approaches, and techniques for computational models of information and its presentation by language (artificial, human, or natural in other ways). The goal is to promote intelligent natural language processing and related models of thought, mental states, reasoning, and other cognitive processes.



TOPICS



The session invites contributions relevant to the following topics, without limitations to them:



- Type theories for applications to language and information processing



- Computational grammar



- Computational semantics



- Computational syntax-semantics interface



- Parsing



- Multilingual processing



- Large-scale grammars of natural languages



- Models of computation and algorithms for natural language processing



- Integration of interdisciplinary methods, e.g., formal, computational, model theoretic, graphical, diagrammatic, statistical, and other related methods



- Computational models of partiality, underspecification, and context-dependency



- Models of situations, contexts, and agents, for applications to language processing



- Bio-information and natural language



- Language processing based on biological fundamentals of information and languages



- Computational neuroscience of language

are glad to invite you to the

NooJ 2016 International Conference

held in

České Budějovice (Czech Republic),

9-11 June 2016.

NooJ is both a corpus processing tool and a linguistic development environment that allows linguists

to formalize several levels of linguistic phenomena:

 typography and spelling;

 syllabification, phonemic and prosodic transcription;

 lexicons of simple words, multiword units, and discontinuous expressions;

 inflectional, derivational and agglutinative morphology;

 local and structural syntax;

 transformational syntax and paraphrase generation;

 semantic analysis and machine translation.

NooJ provides linguists with regular grammars, context-free grammars, context-sensitive grammars

and unrestricted grammars as well as their graphical equivalent (finite-state, recursive and contextual

graphs) to enable the description of each phenomenon. NooJ’s multi-layer approach allows linguists

to accumulate elementary descriptions and describe phenomena that cross linguistic levels. As a

corpus processing tool, NooJ allows users to apply sophisticated linguistic queries to large corpora in

real time, in order to construct indices and concordances, annotate texts automatically and perform

semantic and statistical analyses, etc.

NooJ is open-source, freely available at www.nooj4nlp.net and over 20 linguistic modules can

already be freely downloaded, as well as a manual, video tutorials, references, etc.

The NooJ conference intends to:

 give NooJ users and researchers in Linguistics and in Computational Linguistics the

opportunity to meet and share their experience as developers, researchers and teachers;

 present to NooJ users the latest linguistic resources and NLP applications developed for/with

NooJ, its latest functionalities, as well as its future developments;

 offer researchers and graduate students two tutorials (one basic and one advanced) to help

them parse corpora and build NLP applications using NooJ;

 provide an occasion to present and discover the recent developments of NooJ itself (v5).

TOPICS OF INTEREST

Linguistic resources: Typography, Spelling, Syllabification, Phonemic and Prosodic transcription,

Morphology, Lexical Analysis, Local Syntax, Structural Syntax, Transformational Analysis,

Paraphrase Generation, Semantic annotations, Semantic analysis.

Corpus processing: Corpus Linguistics, Information extraction, Discourse Analysis, Business

Intelligence, NLP applications.

The workshop focuses on linguistic complexity and its relevance in the field of natural language processing. We propose a cross-discipline workshop that foster exchange of ideas between people in the area of artificial intelligence and natural language processing and people dealing with natural language complexity from a cognitive or a theoretical point of view. The main objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers from different areas that have in common their interest on linguistic complexity (from a practical or theoretical perspective) boosting the interchange of knowledge and methods between specialists that have approached complexity from different viewpoints. We want to promote interdisciplinarity among researchers that are dealing with any type of language complexity.



Complexity has become an important concept in several scientific disciplines. There has been a lot of research on complexity and complex systems in the natural sciences, economics, social sciences and, now, also increasingly in linguistics. Moreover, linguistic complexity may be a key point in automatic natural language processing, since results in that field may condition the design of language technologies.



Are all languages equally complex? Does it make sense to compare the complexity of languages? Can languages differ in complexity? Complexity is a controversial concept in linguistics. Until recently, natural language complexity has not been widely researched and still not clear how complexity has to be defined and measured. Twentieth century most theoretical linguists have defended the equi-complexity dogma, which states that the total complexity of a natural language is fixed because sub-complexities in linguistic sub-systems trade off. This idea of equi-complexity, seen for decades as an unquestioned truism of linguistics, has begun to be explicitly questioned in recent years. There have been attempts to apply the concept of complexity used in other disciplines in order to find useful tools to calculate linguistic complexity. Information theory, computational models or the theory of complex systems are examples of areas that provide measures to quantitatively evaluate linguistic complexity.



Many models have been proposed to confirm or refute the hypothesis of linguistic equi-complexity. The tools, criteria and measures to quantify the level of complexity of languages vary and depend on the specific research interests and on the definition of complexity adopted. In fact, there is no agreement in the literature about how to define complexity. Instead, in the literature, we can find a variety of approaches that has led to linguistic complexity taxonomy: absolute complexity vs. relative complexity; global complexity vs. local complexity; system complexity vs. structural complexity, etc. Currently, there is no clear solution to quantify the complexity of languages and each of the proposed models has advantages and disadvantages.



In this workshop, we are interested in contributions introducing new methods, models, definitions and measures to assess natural languages complexity (in human and automatic processing). We are especially interested in computational and formal approaches to linguistic complexity.

 The purpose of the conference series International Workshop on Computational

Linguistics for Uralic Languages is to bring together researchers working on

computational approaches to working with these languages. We accept long and

short papers as well as tutorial proposals working on the following languages:

Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian, Võro, the Sámi languages, Komi (Zyrian, Permyak),

Mordvin (Erzya, Moksha), Mari (Hill, Meadow), Udmurt, Nenets (Tundra, Forest),

Enets, Nganasan, Selkup, Mansi, Khanty, Veps, Karelian (Olonets), Karelian,

Ingrian (Izhorian), Votic, Livonian, Ludic, and other related languages.

 All Uralic languages exhibit rich morphological structure, which makes

processing them challenging for state-of-the-art computational linguistic

approaches, the majority also suffer from a lack of resources and many are

endangered.



 Research papers should be original, substantial and unpublished research, that

can describe work-in-progress systems, frameworks, standards and evaluation

schemes. Demos and tutorials will present systems and standards towards the goal

of interoperability and unification of different projects, applications and

research groups Appropriate topics include (but are not limited to):



 * Parsers, analysers and processing pipelines of Uralic languages

* Lexical databases, electronic dictionaries

* Finished end-user applications aimed at Uralic languages, such as spelling or

  grammar checkers, machine translation or speech processing

* Evaluation methods and gold standards, tagged corpora, treebanks

* Reports on language-independent or unsupervised methods as applied to Uralic

  languages

* Surveys and review articles on subjects related to computational linguistics

  for one or more Uralic languages

* Any work that aims at combining efforts and reducing duplication of work

* How to elicit activity from the language community, agitation campaigns, games

  with a purpose



 To maximise the possibility of reproducibility, replication and reuse, we

particularly encourage submissions which present free/open-source language

resources and make use of free/open-source software.  One of the aims of this

gathering is to avoid unnecessary duplicated work in field of Uralistics by

establishing connections and interoperability standards between researchers and

research groups working at different sites. We have also identified a serious

lack of gold standards and evaluation metrics for all Uralic languages including

those with national support, any work towards better resources in these fields

will be greatly appreciated.



 In this year’s edition, we encourage people to present comparative evaluations

of different NLP methods as applied to Uralic languages. With all the buzz around

neural and deep-learning methods: Are they applicable to Uralic languages, which

in general have very little training data --- even monolingual data --- and also

richer morphology than the more widely treated Indo-European languages."

September 23rd 2013, Pisa, Italy, http://ldl2013.org



Collocated with the 6th Conference on Generative Approaches to the Lexicon (GL2013)





The explosion of information technology has led to a substantial growth in quantity, diversity and complexity of linguistic data accessible over the internet. The lack of interoperability between linguistic and language resources represents a major challenge that needs to be addressed, in particular, if information from different sources is to be combined, like, say, machine-readable lexicons, corpus data and terminology repositories. For these types of resources, domain-specific standards have been proposed, yet, issues of interoperability between different types of resources persist, commonly accepted strategies to distribute, access and integrate their information have yet to be established, and technologies and infrastructures to address both aspects are still under development.



The goal of the workshop is to assemble researchers from various fields of linguistics, natural language processing, and information technology to present and discuss principles, case studies, and best practices for representing, publishing and linking linguistic data collections, including corpora, dictionaries, lexical networks, translation memories, thesauri, etc., infrastructures developed on that basis, their use of existing standards, and the publication and distribution policies that were adopted.



We particularly invite contributions discussing the application of the Linked Open Data paradigm to linguistic data as it might provide an important step towards making linguistic data: i) easily and uniformly queryable, ii) interoperable and iii) sharable over the Web using open standards such as the HTTP protocol and the RDF data model [1]. Recent research in this direction has lead to the emergence of a Linked Open Data cloud of linguistic resources, the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud, where Linked Data principles were applied to language resources, allowing them to be published and linked in a principled way [2]. Although not restricted to lexical resources, these play a particularly prominent role in this context [3].



The intended audience includes computational linguists and NLP engineers interested in the application of Semantic Web formalisms and related technologies to language data, empirically-working linguists and lexicographers interested in the representation, exchange and interlinking of linguistic data and metadata, and developers of infrastructures for linguistic data and other researchers with an interest in both aspects. 



Background and History



LDL-2013 is organized in the context of two recent community efforts, the Open Linguistics Working Group of the Open Knowledge Foundation (OWLG), and the W3C Ontology-Lexica Community Group. The Open Linguistics Working Group has spearheaded the creation of new data and the republishing of existing linguistic resources as linked open data. Similarly, the W3C Ontology-Lexica Community Group is seeking to develop standard models for representing and publishing (ontology-) lexica and other lexical resources as RDF.



The workshop is continuing a series of workshops on the application of the Linked Data paradigm to linguistic data that have been initiated and organized by the Open Linguistics Working Group: The First Workshop on Linked Data in Linguistics (LDL-2012) was conducted in March 2012 at the University of Frankfurt am Main/Germany, and collocated with the 34th Annual Meeting of the German Linguistics Society (DGfS-2012). The Workshop on Multilingual Linked Open Data for Enterprises (MLODE-2012) was conducted in September 2012 at the University of Leipzig/Germany, and collocated with the 3rd Conference on Software Agents and Services for Business, Research and E-Science (SABRE-2012). We intend to continue both series of workshops, with LDL workshops being attached to (computational) linguistic venues, and MLODE workshops co-located with information technology events.



Topics of Interest



We invite contributions related (but not limited) to the following topics:

1. Use cases and project proposals for the creation, maintenance and publication of linguistic data collections that are linked with other resources

2. Modelling linguistic data and metadata with OWL and/or RDF

3. Ontologies for linguistic data and metadata collections

4. Applications of such data, other ontologies or linked data from any subdiscipline of linguistics (may include work in progress or project descriptions)

5. Descriptions of data sets, ideally following Linked Data principles

6. Legal and social aspects of Linguistic Linked Open Data





Submission & Publication



We accept submission of both long (up to 8 pages plus 2 pages for references) and short papers (up to 4 pages plus 2 pages for references) to be presented as long or short oral presentation at the workshop. The papers of the workshop will be published as CEUR proceedings. In addition, we aim for a journal special issue as post-conference proceedings in which a selected amount of papers presented at the workshop will be published.

CALL FOR PAPERS 

=======================



The 10th Linguistic Annotation Workshop (The LAW X)

http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/conf/law-x-2016



Held in conjunction with ACL/HLT 2016, Berlin/Germany, August 2016

Sponsored by the ACL Special Interest Group on Annotation (SIGANN)







WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION 

========================



Linguistic annotation of natural language corpora is the backbone of supervised methods for statistical natural language processing. It also provides valuable data for evaluation of both rule-based and supervised systems and can help formalize and study linguistic phenomena. 



The LAW provides a forum for presentation and discussion of innovative research on all aspects of linguistic annotation, including creation/evaluation of annotation schemes, methods for automatic and manual annotation, use and evaluation of annotation software and frameworks, representation of linguistic data and annotations, evaluation of manual and automatically-produced annotations, etc. 





SPECIAL THEME

=======================

We encourage submission of papers relating to this year's theme: Evaluation of Annotation Quality.



This special theme considers current practice in evaluation of linguistic annotations and its successes and failures by asking questions such as: How are we as a community measuring inter-annotator agreement to date, and are there sounder ways to measure it? How can we estimate the annotation quality of existing resources, and what can be done to document annotated data to help others assess its reliability? 



We encourage submissions addressing the following topics related to the special theme:

How agreement is measured in various (new or existing) annotation projects, and what the different scores tell us in each case. 

Good acceptance thresholds for different annotation tasks and metrics, and/or how to determine them.

Previously proposed but not widely used measures for agreement or annotation quality.

Proposals for quantitative or qualitative methods to measure agreement or annotation quality.

Proposals for documentation of published resources to support their evaluation, means and methods to achieve community evaluation of linguistically-annotated resources, etc.





WORKSHOP TOPICS

=======================

We welcome submissions of long and short papers, posters, and demonstrations, relating to the topics of the special theme and to any aspect of linguistic annotation, including:        



== Annotation procedures ==

- Innovative automated and manual strategies for annotation.

- Machine learning and knowledge-based methods for automation of corpus annotation.

- Creation, maintenance, and interactive exploration of annotation structures and annotated data.



== Annotation evaluation ==

- Inter-annotator agreement and other evaluation metrics and strategies.

- Qualitative evaluation of linguistic representation.



== Annotation access and use ==

- Representation formats/structures for merged annotations of different phenomena, and means to explore/manipulate them.

- Linguistic considerations for merging annotations of distinct phenomena.



== Annotation schemes, guidelines and standards ==

- New and innovative annotation schemes, comparison of annotation schemes.

- Best practices for annotation procedures and/or development and documentation of annotation schemes.

- Interoperability of annotation formats and/or frameworks among different systems as well as different tasks, frameworks, modalities, and languages.

- Results on the application and evaluation of standards for (linguistic) annotation.



== Annotation software and frameworks ==

- Development, evaluation and/or innovative use of annotation software frameworks.





SUBMISSIONS and REVIEWING

=========================



Submissions should report original and unpublished research on topics of interest for the workshop. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop, and will be published in the workshop proceedings. They should emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results.



A paper accepted for presentation at the workshop must not be or have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings.



The maximum length is eight (8) pages of content for long papers and four (4) pages of content for short papers, posters, and demonstrations, plus up to two (2) pages of references.

Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore, the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations or self-references that reveal the authors’ identity, e.g., ""We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."" should be replaced with citations such as ""Smith (1991) previously showed ..."". Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

Authors of papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must provide this information to the workshop co-chairs (law-x-2016@coli.uni-saarland.de). Authors of accepted papers must notify the program chairs within 10 days of acceptance if the paper is withdrawn for any reason.



If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the program co-chairs (law-x-2016@coli.uni-saarland.de).

Description



Machine comprehension of Evaluative, Affective and Subjective (EAS) language on par with human understanding requires identification and understanding fine grained emotions, beliefs, opinions, and judgements expressed in language both implicitly and explicitly. The goal of this workshop is to focus the attention of the NLP research community on combining deep learning/statistical NLP techniques with richer/deeper semantic representations driven by computational linguistics in analysing and understanding EAS text. This workshop is intended to throw down the gauntlet to the NLP community both in the computational linguistics camp and the machine learning camp, to achieve human-level understanding of EAS language.



We invite the NLP research community to explore approaches going beyond bag of words and bag of sentences by combining higher level linguistic insights including discourse level information, pragmatics and other contextual information along with statistical data driven techniques, for better understanding of EAS text. Approaches which explore linguistic phenomena such as figurative language, intent detection as well as the use of extra-linguistic information in terms of the socio-cultural origins of the text, social network structure origins of the text, and author social network profiles in understanding EAS text would also be of interest. We are also interested in non-trivial EAS text applications which go beyond mere identification of evaluative, emotive, subjective cue phrases to underlying causative events/reasons/arguments which give rise to these emotions/feelings/beliefs/subjective opinions. Non-trivial benchmarks for comparing machine comprehension of EAS aspects with human understanding are also welcome.



Topics of interest





Topics of interest include but are not limited to:



·         richer/deeper linguistic representations of aspects of EAS



·         understanding of cognitive processing of EAS language



·         extra-linguistic aspects of EAS language



·         socio-cultural aspects of EAS language



·         psycholinguistic aspects of EAS text analysis



·         interpretability of deep learning-based EAS analysis systems



·         identifying origins/dynamic contexts/causative events/reasons in EAS text analysis (including the fields of stance detection, subjective judgements/beliefs detection, argumentation in both emotive and evaluative texts).





Submission Requirements



We solicit both long and short paper submissions. All papers must describe substantial, original, and unpublished work. Submissions will be judged on appropriateness, clarity, originality/innovativeness, correctness/soundness, meaningful comparison, thoroughness, significance, contributions to research resources, and replicability. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.



Both long and short papers must follow the two-column format of EACL 2017. For the original submission, long papers may be up to eight (8) pages in length plus unlimited pages of references, whereas short papers may be up to four (4) pages in length plus unlimited pages of references. Both long and short papers will be given one additional page of content for the camera-ready version.



Papers will be presented orally or as posters, as determined by the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and which as posters will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and as posters.



As the reviewing will be blind, papers must not include authors’ names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author’s identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith (1991) previously showed …” Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.



Papers that have only appeared on preprint servers such as arXiv.org, do not count as previously published, and may be submitted to the workshop. Note that the version submitted for review must be suitably anonymized, and should not contain references to the prior non-archival version.

In multilingual situations, language technologies are crucial for providing access to information and opportunities for economic development. With somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 different languages, Africa is a multilingual continent par excellence and presents acute challenges for those seeking to promote and use African languages in the areas of business development, education, research, and relief aid. In recent times a number of African researchers and institutions have come forward that share the common goal of developing capabilities in language technologies. This workshop provides a forum to meet and share the latest developments in this field. It also seeks to include linguists who specialize in African languages and would like to leverage the tools and approaches of computational linguistics, as well as computational linguists who are interested in learning about the particular linguistic challenges posed by African languages.



The workshop will consist of an invited talk, followed by refereed research papers in computational linguistics. The focus will be on sub-Saharan African languages, excluding Arabic and languages with European origins, such as Afrikaans and African variants of English and French. We invite submissions on any topic related to language and speech technology and African languages including, but not limited to, the following:



+ Corpora and corpus annotation

+ Machine readable lexicons

+ Morphological analyzers and spelling checkers

+ Part of speech taggers and parsers

+ Speech recognition and synthesis

+ Applications such as machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval, computer-assisted language learning and question answering

+ The role of language technologies in economic development, education, healthcare, and emergency and public services

+ Documentation of endangered languages and the use of language technologies to enhance language vitality

+ The combination of language and speech technology with mobile phone technology.



OBJECTIVES OF THE WORKSHOP

+ Assess the state-of-the-art in the development of BLARKs for sub-Saharan African languages

+ Address issues of efficient and sufficient collection and annotation of spoken and written language samples

+ Define particular issues in machine translation, speech recognition, and other language technology applications

+ Discuss community needs in education and vitality of language and culture, such as localization of operating systems and applications, spelling checkers, dictionaries, computer assisted language learning and the like

+ Assess the role of language technology in bridging the digital divide, particularly in light of rapidly emerging technologies, such as mobile phones

+ Strengthen the network of researchers working in the domain of African Language Technology

Call for papers for NooJ 2011 Conference

****************************************

Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences of the University of Zagreb (FFZG), Croatian Language Technologies Society (HDJT) the Laboratoire de Sémio-Linguistique et Didactique (LASELDI) of the University Franche-Comté and the Maison des Sciences de l'Homme et de l'Environnement Ledoux organize the 2011 NooJ Conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia from 13-15 June, 2011.



NooJ is both a corpus processing tool and a linguistic development environment: it allows linguists to formalize several levels of linguistic phenomena: orthography and spelling; lexicons of simple words; multiword units and frozen expressions; inflectional, derivational and productive morphology; local, structural syntax and transformational syntax. For each of these levels NooJ provides linguists with one or more formal tools specifically designed to facilitate the description of each phenomenon, as well as parsing tools designed to be as computationally efficient as possible. This approach distinguishes NooJ from most computational linguistic tools, which provide a single formalism that could describe every linguistic phenomena. As a corpus processing tool, NooJ allows users to apply sophisticated linguistic queries to large corpora in order to build indices and concordances, annotate texts automatically, perform statistical analyses, etc.



NooJ is freely available and linguistic modules can already be freely downloaded for Acadian, Arabic, Armenian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, French, English, German, Hebrew, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and Turkish. A dozen other modules are under construction.



**************************

The conference intends to:

**************************

*	give NooJ users and researchers in Linguistics and in Computational Linguistics the opportunity to meet and share their experience as developers, researchers and teachers; 

*	present to NooJ users the latest linguistic resources and NLP applications developed for/with NooJ, its latest functionalities, as well as its future developments; 

*	offer researchers and graduate students two tutorials (one basic and one advanced) to help them parse corpora and build NLP applications using NooJ. 

*	provide the occasion to present and discover the recent developments of NooJ itself (v3.0).



*******************

Topics of interest:

*******************

*	Semantic analysis

*	Syntactic analysis

*	Lexical analysis

*	Linguistic resources

*	Dictionaries

Announcement and Call for Papers



*** FOURTH WORKSHOP ON CONTROLLED NATURAL LANGUAGE (CNL 2014) ***



Co-located with COLING 2014 



20-22 August 2014

Galway, Ireland



http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/site/cnl2014/



Proceedings in Springer LNCS.



---------------------------------------------------------------------





This workshop on controlled natural language (CNL) has a broad scope

and embraces all approaches that are based on natural language and

apply restrictions on vocabulary, grammar, and/or semantics. This

includes (but is certainly not limited to) approaches that have been

called simplified language, plain language, formalized language,

processable language, fragments of language, phraseologies,

conceptual authoring, language generation, and guided natural

language interfaces.



Some CNLs are designed to improve communication among humans,

especially for non-native speakers of the respective natural

language. In other cases, the restrictions on the language are

supposed to make it easier for computers to analyze such texts in

order to improve computer-aided, semi-automatic, or automatic

translations into other languages. A third group of CNL has the goal

to enable reliable automated reasoning and formal knowledge

representation from seemingly natural texts. All these types of CNL

are covered by this workshop. 





Topics

------



Possible topics for CNL 2014 include:



- CNL for knowledge representation

- CNL for query interfaces

- CNL for specifications

- CNL for business rules

- CNL for dialogue systems

- CNL for machine translation

- CNL for improved understandability of texts

- CNL for natural language generation

- design of CNLs

- CNL applications

- CNL evaluation

- usability and acceptance of CNL

- CNL grammars and lexica

- multilingual CNLs

- reasoning in CNL

- spoken CNL

- CNL in the context of the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data

- CNL in the government

- CNL in industry

- CNL use cases

- theoretical properties of CNL





Important Dates

---------------



Submission deadline (extended):  31 March 2014

Notification of acceptance:      12 May 2014

Deadline for revised papers:     9 June 2014

Workshop:                        20-22 August 2014

Computational Linguistics - Applications Workshop (CLA'09)

http://cla.imcsit.org/



event of



 International Multiconference on Computer Science

and Information Technology (IMCSIT 2009)



12-14 October 2009, Mragowo, Poland





The CLA Workshop is located within the framework of the IMCSIT conference to create a dialog between researchers and practitioners involved in Computational Linguistics and related areas of Information Technology.



IMSCIT is a multi-disciplinary conference gathering scientists form the different fields of IT & Computer Science together with representatives of industry and end-users. IMSCIT with its motto: ""new ideas are born not inside peoples' heads but in the space between them"", quickly became a unique place to share thoughts and ideas. This year's gathering is held in October 2009 in a beautiful town of Mragowo in the midst of Mazury Lake Country.





Workshop Goals



    The Computational Linguistics - Applications Workshop was created in 2008 in response to the fast-paced progress in the area.



    Traditionally, computational linguistics was limited to the scientists specialized in the processing of a natural language by computers. Scientific approaches and practical techniques come from linguistics, computer science, psychology, and mathematics. Nowadays, there is a number of practical applications available. These applications are sometimes developed by smart yet NLP-untrained developers who solve the problems using sophisticated heuristics.



    Computational Linguistics needs to be applied to make the full use of the Internet. There is a definite need for software that can handle unstructured text to allow search for information on the web. According to the European Commission, Human Language Technologies are one of the key research areas for the upcoming years. The priority aim of the research in this area is to enable users to communicate with the computer in their native language.



    CLA'09 Workshop is a place where the parties meet to exchange views and ideas with a benefit to all involved. The Workshop will focus on practical outcome of modeling human language use and the applications needed to improve human-machine interaction.





Paper Topics



    This call is for papers that present research and developments on all aspects of Natural Language Processing used in real-life applications, such as (this list is not exhaustive):



        *  information retrieval

        *  extraction of linguistic knowledge from text corpora

        *  semantic ontologies in computer linguistics

        *  lexical resources

        *  machine translation and translation aids

        *  ambiguity resolution

        *  text classification

        *  corpus-based language modeling

        *  POS-tagging

        *  parsing issues

        *  proofing tools

        *  dialogue systems

        *  machine learning methods applied to language processing

        *  ontology and taxonomy evaluation

        *  opinion mining

        *  question answering

        *  sentiment analysis

        *  speech and audio processing

        *  text summarization

        *  use of NLP techniques in practical applications





Paper Presentation



    The presentation of the paper has to include a demonstration of an existing tool. The papers should include a section describing the tool (or a prototype), which demonstrates the theory discussed in the paper.



    The presentation is divided into two parts. First, the author(s) shortly demonstrate their tools to the audience. In the second part, the authors discuss their work with other participants and let the audience test their software.



    Papers will be evaluated and accepted on the basis of their technical merit, usefulness of the real life application and relevance to the workshop scope by the CLA'09 Program Committee. The paper will be assessed by academics as well as industry representatives in order to assure fair and balanced assessment.



    All accepted and presented papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings and included in the IEEE Xplore® database. The best demonstrations will be selected to be shown to the general audience of the conference at a plenary session.







Papers Submission Requirements



        * Authors should submit full papers (as Postscript, PDF of MSWord file).

        * The submissions are accepted via conference submission system until 2009-05-10 (link will be published soon).

        * The total length of a paper should not exceed 8 pages (IEEE style).

A full-day workshop at LREC 2014

Tuesday, 27 May 2014.

Reykjavik (Iceland)



SALTMIL: http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/saltmil/

LREC 2014: http://lrec2014.lrec-conf.org/en/

Paper submission: https://www.softconf.com/lrec2014/SaLTMiL/



The 9th International Workshop of the Special Interest Group on Speech and Language Technology for Minority Languages (SaLTMiL) will be held in Reykjavík, Iceland, on May 24, 2014, as part of the 2014 International Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC). (For SALTMIL see: http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/saltmil/); it is also framed as one of the activities of European project Abu-Matran (http://www.abumatran.eu). Entitled ""Free/open-source language resources for the machine translation of less-resourced languages"", the workshop is intended to continue the series of SALTMIL/LREC workshops on computational language resources for minority languages, held in Granada (1998), Athens (2000), Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (2002), Lisbon (2004), Genoa (2006), Marrakech (2008), La Valetta (2010) and Istanbul (2012), and is also expected to attract the audience of Free Rule-Based Machine Translation workshops (2009, 2011, 2012). The workshop aims to share information on language resources, tools and best practice, to save isolated researchers from starting from scratch when building machine translation for a less-resourced language. An important aspect will be the strengthening of the free/open-source language resources community, which can minimize duplication of effort and optimize development and adoption, in line with the LREC 2014 hot topic ‘LRs in the Collaborative Age’ (http://is.gd/LREChot).



The whole-day workshop will consist of short oral papers, a poster session preceded by a poster-boaster session (2 minutes, 2 slides per poster), and a round table.



Papers are invited that describe research and development in the following areas:



    FOS LR for rule-based machine translation (dictionaries, rule sets)

    FOS LR for statistical machine translation (corpora)

    FOS tools to annotate, clean, preprocess, convert, etc. LRs for machine translation

    Machine translation as a tool for creating or enriching FOS LRs for less-resourced languages



Position papers and (web based) demonstrations will also be considered for presentation.



The best papers, as evaluated by the programme committee, will be presented orally and the remaining paper will be presented in poster format.



We expect short papers of max 6,000 words (up to 6 pages) describing research addressing one of the above topics, to be submitted as PDF documents by using the LREC 2014 START conference management system (https://www.softconf.com/lrec2014/SaLTMiL/).



Submissions should be anonymized. When submitting a paper through the START page, authors will be kindly asked to share the resources that have been used for the work described in their paper or that are the outcome of their research. For further information on this initiative, please refer to http://lrec2014.lrec-conf.org/en/calls-for-papers/lrec-2014-special-highlight/.



Submissions of papers should follow the same style as the papers for the main LREC conference (an Author's Kit made of specific guidelines and downloadable templates will be published on the conference web site in due time). All contributions will be included in the workshop proceedings (CD). They will also be published on the SALTMIL website.



The registration fees will be duly announced at the LREC 2014 site. Registration in the workshop willl include a coffee break and the Proceedings of the Workshop. Registration will be handled by the LREC 2014 Secretariat.

SHARED TASK DESCRIPTION



This shared task proposes data to experiment on causality detection, and focuses on determining causality associated to an event or to transformations of financial objects.

The  data  are  extracted  from  a  corpus  of  2019  financial  news  provided  by QWAM http://www.qwamci.com/.  

______________________________________________________________________



SUBTASKS



The task contains two subtasks:

a) Sentence classification

This task is a binary classification task. The goal of this subtask is to filter sentences which display causal meanings (1) from the sentences that are noise in regard of causality (0)

b) Cause – effect detection

This task is a relation extraction task. The aim is to identify, in a text block defined as causal (causal sentence or paragraph), the substring displaying the cause and the substring describing the effect.



______________________________________________________________________



DATASET

Two datasets, one for each sub-task, will be released as csv files in three parts each: trial set, training set and test set.

## Format

We invite submissions of two different formats: (1) Original Research Papers and (2) Abstract-based Presentations.



### (1) Original Research Papers



We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all aspects of natural language processing.



Long papers should be 6-8 pages and short papers should be 3-4 pages. Accepted papers will either be delivered as an oral presentation or as a poster presentation. Both short and long papers may include up to 2 pages of references in addition to the page count requirements.



Note that the review process is double-blind, and accordingly submitted papers should not include the identity of author(s) and the text should be suitably anonymised, e.g. using third person wording for self-citations, not providing URLs to your person website, etc. Original research papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which will be published online in the ACL anthology and the ALTA website. Long papers will be distinguished from short papers in the proceedings.



### (2) Abstract-based Presentations



To encourage broader participation and facilitate local socialisation of international results, we invite 1-2 page presentation abstracts. Accepted abstracts will either be delivered as an oral presentation or as a poster presentation. Submissions should include presentation title and abstract, name of the presenter, any publications relating to the work, and any information on collaboration with the local ALTA community. Abstracts will not be published in the proceedings, but simply reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to ensure that they are on topic, coherent and likely to be of interest to the ALTA community. Abstracts on work in progress and work published or submitted elsewhere are encouraged. ALTA invites submissions of all manner interesting research, not limited to, but including:



- established academics giving an overview of an exciting paper or paper/s published in international venues;

- completing research students giving an overview of their thesis work;

- early candidature research students presenting their work-in-progress and ideas, which may not have been published; and

- industry presenting research and development over linguistic data in the context of their business.



Presentation abstracts should not be anonymised, any publications relating to the work should be cited in the submission, and the person who will give the presentation should be clearly stated.





## Guidelines



Submissions must follow the two-column ACL format. We therefore strongly recommend you use LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word template (found here: http://www.acl2019.org/EN/call-for-papers.xhtml).





## Topics



ALTA invites the submission of papers and presentations on all aspects of natural language processing, including, but not limited to:



- phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse;

- speech understanding and generation;

- interpreting spoken and written language;

- natural language generation;

- linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language;

- NLP-based information extraction and retrieval;

- corpus-based and statistical language modelling;

- machine translation and translation aids;

- question answering and information extraction;

- natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;

- natural language and multimodal systems;

- message and narrative understanding systems;

- evaluations of language systems;

- embodied conversational agents;

- computational lexicography;

- summarisation;

- language resources;

- topic modelling and unsupervised language analysis;

- social media analysis and processing;

- domain-specific adaptation of natural language processing algorithms; and

- applied natural language processing and/or applications in industry.



We particularly encourage submissions that broaden the scope of our community through the consideration of practical applications of language technology and through multi-disciplinary research. We also specifically encourage submissions from industry.





## Multiple Submission Policy



Original research papers that are under review for other publication venues or that you intend to submit elsewhere may be submitted in parallel to ALTA. We require that you declare at submission that your paper is submitted to another venue, and identify the venue. Should your paper be accepted to both ALTA and another venue, we allow you to decide whether the paper should be published in the ALTA proceedings, or if it should be treated as a Presentation (without archival publication). In this case you would still be able to present a research talk at the ALTA workshop. This is to encourage more internationally leading research to be presented at the workshop."

NLP tools contests at ICON 2015



The ICON 2014 tools contest is on on Statistical Machine Translation in Indian Languages(IL). Machine translation (MT) is the process of encoding the syntactic and semantic information of a source language text into a target language. In past two decades, MT has shown very promising results particularly using Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) especially for English and other European Languages. However, its effectiveness in translating sentences within Indian Languages (IL) and between English and Indian languages needs to be explored further. The NLP tool contest in ICON 2014 aims to collectively explore the effectiveness of SMT while translating within ILs and between English and ILs.

The 3rd International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Informal Text  (NLPIT 2017)

In conjunction with The International Conference on Web Engineering (ICWE 2017), 

June 5, 2017, Rome, Italy

http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~badiehm/nlpit2017/

##################################################



Overview

###########

The rapid growth of Internet usage in the last two decades adds new challenges to understand the informal user generated content (UGC) on the Internet. Textual UGC refers to textual posts on social media, blogs, emails, chat conversations, instant messages, forums, reviews, or advertisements that are created by end-users of an online system. A large portion of language used on textual UGC is informal. Informal text is the style of writing that disregards language grammars and uses a mixture of abbreviations and context dependent terms. The straightforward application of state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing approaches on informal text typically results in significantly degraded performance due to the following reasons: the lack of sentence structure; the lack of enough context required; the seldom entities involved; the noisy sparse contents of users' contributions; and the untrusted facts contained. It is the aim of this workshop to bring the attention of researchers to the opportunities and challenges involved in informal text processing. In particular, we are interested in discussing informal text modeling, normalization, mining, and understanding in addition to various application areas in which UGC is involved.



Topics

###########

We invite submissions on topics that include, but are not limited to, the following core NLP approaches for informal UGC: language identification, classification, clustering, filtering, summarization, tokenization, segmentation, morphological analysis, POS tagging, parsing, named entity extraction, named entity disambiguation, relation/fact extraction, semantic annotation, sentiment analysis, language normalization, informality modeling and measuring, language generation, handling uncertainties, machine translation, ontology construction, dictionary construction, etc.

Title: Overcoming the Language Barrier with BabelNet and Multilingual Disambiguation of Text



Abstract: Multilinguality is a key feature of today’s Web, and it is this feature that we leverage and exploit in our research work at the Sapienza University of Rome’s Linguistic Computing Laboratory, which I am going to overview and showcase in this talk. I will start by presenting BabelNet (http://babelnet.org), the largest multilingual encyclopedic dictionary and semantic network (now also a knowledge base), which covers 271 languages and 14 million concepts and named entities. BabelNet provides both coverage for all the open-class parts of speech, thanks to the seamless integration of WordNet, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, OmegaWiki, Wikidata and the Open Multilingual WordNet. Next, I will present Babelfy (http://babelfy.org), a unified approach that leverages BabelNet to jointly perform word sense disambiguation and entity linking in arbitrary languages, with performance on both tasks on a par with, or surpassing, those of task-specific state-of-the-art supervised systems. Babelfy also includes a language-agnostic setting in which languages can be mixed in arbitrary ways. Finally, I will describe the most recent developments, including deep learning approaches to latent vector representations of meaning and word sense disambiguation.



Bio: Roberto Navigli is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science of the Sapienza University of Rome. He was awarded the Marco Somalvico 2013 AI*IA Prize for the best young researcher in AI. He is the first Italian recipient of an ERC Starting Grant in computer science, on multilingual word sense disambiguation (2011-2016), and one of the few computer scientists to have received two ERC Grants (a Consolidator Grant starting in 2017). He was a co-PI of a Google Focused Research Award on Natural Language Understanding. In 2015 he received the META prize for groundbreaking work in overcoming language barriers with BabelNet, a project also highlighted in TIME magazine this year. His research lies in the field of Natural Language Processing (including multilingual word sense disambiguation and induction, multilingual entity linking, large-scale knowledge acquisition, ontology learning from scratch, gamification for NLP, open information extraction and relation extraction). Currently he is an Associate Editor of the Artificial Intelligence Journal.

Computational Linguistics and Writing:

Writing Processes and Authoring Aids (CL&W 2010)



Workshop at NAACL-HLT 2010



(http://www.lingured.info/clw2010/)



Workshop date: June 5 or 6, 2010



Location: Los Angeles, USA



Submission deadline: March 1, 2010



*********************************************************************



Writing today, whether professional, academic, or private, relies

heavily on computers.  Most texts composed in the 21st century are

probably written on computers or other electronic devices, such as

mobile phones.  People compose texts in word processors, text editors,

content management systems, blogs, wikis, e-mail clients, and instant

messaging applications.  Each of these tools supports authors in

different ways.



Writing research has been concerned with word processing since the

1970s.  Writing researchers today investigate specific characteristics

of writing with computers and the effect of tools on writing

processes.  The current rise of new writing environments and genres

(e.g., blogging) has prompted new studies in this area of research.



During the last few decades, computational linguistics has mostly been

concerned with static or finished texts.  We believe there is now a

growing need to explore how computational linguistics can support

human text production and word processing.  However, there are still

very few projects where computational linguists and writing

researchers work together.



The Workshop on Computational Linguistics and Writing (CL&W 2010) aims

to provide an overview of current developments in the area of

computational linguistics for authoring aids, and an overview of

recent advances in writing research.  CL&W 2010 continues and builds

on the workshops on authoring aids at LREC 2008 and SLTC 2008.  We are

interested in research that explores writing processes and text

production, as well as in actual systems that support writers.  In

both areas, research on all languages is relevant, including

less-resourced languages.  We aim to bring together researchers from

both communities, to identify areas where computational linguistics

and writing research could benefit from each other and to stimulate

discussion and interdisciplinary cooperation between these two areas

of research.



At CL&W 2010 we would like to address questions like the following:



* How can writing be supported by methods, resources, and tools from

  computational linguistics?  This includes NLP tools and techniques

  that can be used or have been used to support writing (e.g., grammar

  and style checking, document structuring, thematic segmentation,

  editing and revision aids).

* How can we get a better understanding of writing processes,

  strategies, and needs?  How can techniques from HCI research and

  psychology help us to gain new insights into composing and writing

  processes and to improve writing tools?

* Which methods, resources, and tools from computational linguistics

  could support research in this area?

* How do high-level writing processes and the mechanics of writing

  relate to each other?

* How does the tool influence composing (including editing and

  revising)?  Are writers aware of the possibilities and limitations

  of their writing tools?

* Is there a need for the development of new writing tools?  What can

  we learn from earlier approaches and tools like RUSKIN, Writer's

  Workbench, or Augment, or from source code editors for programming

  languages?

* How can insights from writing research and methods from

  computational linguistics help to support the needs of particular

  user groups (e.g., foreign language learners, children, persons with

  disabilities)?





*Topics*



Topics of interest for this workshop include, but are not limited to,

the following:



   * Tools to assist writers 

   * Linguistic resources for authoring aids 

   * Algorithms and techniques for authoring aids 

   * Tools to support research on writing processes 

   * Methods and techniques for investigating writing processes

   * Effects of writing tools on writing processes

   * User interface and HCI issues in current and future writing tools 

   * Authoring aids for specific applications and user groups

   * Pedagogical writing tools 

   * Predictive tools and techniques 

   * Multilinguality and authoring tools 

   * Evaluation of tools, methods, techniques, and resources 





*Format of the Workshop*



We will have two sessions and a plenary discussion.  Talks addressing

mainly questions from writing research will be presented in one

session, talks addressing mainly questions related to computational

linguistics will be presented in the other session.  The plenary

discussion is intended to combine the two views, to identify future

directions for research, and to stimulate interdisciplinary networking

and cooperation between writing researchers and computational

linguists.





*Submissions*



We invite researchers to submit full papers of up to 8 pages (and 1

additional page for references) or short papers of up to 4 pages

(including references).  These page limits must be strictly observed.

Submissions must be in English.



Reviewing of papers will be double-blind by the members of the program

committee, and all submissions will receive several independent

reviews.  Papers submitted at review stage must not contain the

authors' names, affiliations, or any information that may disclose the

authors' identity.  Furthermore, self-references that reveal the

author's identity, e.g., ""We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."",

should be avoided.  Instead, use citations such as ""Smith previously

showed (Smith, 1991) ..."".  Do not use anonymous citations.  Do not

include acknowledgments.  Papers that do not conform to these

requirements will be rejected without review.



All submissions must be electronic in PDF and must follow the

two-column format of ACL proceedings.  It is very important to specify

US Letter paper format.  Authors are strongly recommended to use the

style files provided at (http://naaclhlt2010.isi.edu/authors.html).

All camera-ready manuscripts should look like the sample PDF file

(http://naaclhlt2010.isi.edu/docs/style/latex/naaclhlt2010.pdf), which

also contains detailed formatting requirements.



Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their research

at the workshop.  Accepted papers will be published in the electronic

proceedings of the workshop by ACL.  Workshop proceedings will be part

of the NAACL-HLT 2010 proceedings.



Submission is electronic using the START submission system at:

We have also composed a FAQ (check our website) addressing potential topics and approaches to the questions posed in the call for papers. We would also like to emphasize once more that the conference is not exclusive to linguists - researchers and industry representatives from any field working on human language are welcome to share their ideas.



Call for Papers:



After decades of seemingly scattered research, the question of how linguistics fits into the bigger picture of the sciences and the world of knowledge in general has surfaced in connection with new methods and technological advances which deal with natural language and communication, attempt to simulate them, or use linguistic knowledge to interpret human behavior.

This conference proposes a constructive take on the question 'Why?', as in, why are we doing what we are doing as linguists, and what is our contribution to knowledge? Or, equally well, what is the contribution of a particular domain of linguistics to other disciplines, and in turn, their contribution to linguistics? To what end do linguistics and any such neighboring fields of research or industry converge in their methods, results and problem setting? This is intended to be the binding theme of this otherwise highly interdisciplinary event.

In order to approach these issues from a variety of angles, we invite papers on the subject of linguistics in and for:    

- technology and engineering

- neuroscience, psychology, clinical applications

- endangered communities

- understanding human origins

- didactics and acquisition

- translation and terminology

- solving crimes

- understanding thinking and reasoning

- understanding society

- understanding human communication

Taking into account the interdisciplinary nature of the conference, participants are advised to give a brief overview in their presentation of the ""what"" and ""how"" of their research, but nevertheless focus on the ""why"". For researchers working in the applied and technical domains, the answer may be clear due to the inherently more action- or product-oriented nature of their research. However, we believe that open discussion on this topic is beneficial for the realization of the full potential of theoretical linguistic research and for the interaction of linguistics with other disciplines.

Participants from the more applied fields of research should, therefore, put emphasis on the contribution of theoretical domains of linguistics from the point of view of their research, and conversely, representatives of the theoretical fields should point to the applicability of their research. Both positive and negative assessments are equally welcome, as in why we should or should not invest resources in any particular subdomain of linguistics, its methodology, or its application in another field of research or industry.

The working language of the conference is English. The extended abstract submission deadline is the 22nd of February. For further information, see the conference website: http://whylinguistics.ut.ee

Workshop URL: http://www.taln.upf.edu/pages/cttsr2021-ws/



Thanks to the availability of texts on the Web in recent years, increased knowledge and information have been made available to broader audiences. However, the way in which a text is written— vocabulary, syntax, text organization/structure —can be difficult to read and understand for many people, especially those with low literacy, cognitive or linguistic impairment, or those with limited knowledge of the language of the text. Texts containing uncommon words or long and complicated sentences can be difficult to read and understand by people as well as difficult to analyse by machines. Automatic text simplification is the process of transforming a text into another text which, ideally conveying the same message, will be easier to read and understand by a broader audience.



Research in text simplification has been approached from different angles: rule-based linguistically informed methods, unsupervised corpus-based techniques, supervised machine learning or statistical machine translation have all been attempted in text simplification. Recently, research in text simplification has, like in many other natural language processing areas, increased the use of methods derived from the deep learning paradigm, and more specifically end-to-end sequence to sequence, and transformer-based learning methods. In spite of the current advances in the field, there are many important aspects of the simplification problem that need the attention of our community, including but not limited to: the design of appropriate evaluation metrics, the development of context-aware simplification solutions, the creation of appropriate language resources to support research and evaluation, the deployment of simplification in real environments for real users, the study of discourse factors in text simplification, the identification of factors affecting the readability of a text, etc.



The workshop aims at bringing together researchers, developers and industries of assistive technologies, public organizations representatives, and other parties interested in the problem of making information more accessible to all citizens.  We will discuss recent trends and developments in the area of automatic text simplification, automatic readability assessment, language resources and evaluation for text simplification, etc.



Topics



The workshop aims to receive contributions in the following topics:



●      Lexical Simplification (LS)



●      Syntactic Simplification (SS)



●      Sequence to Sequence Models for LS and SS



●      Modular and End-to-end Text Simplification



●      Zero-shot Text Simplification



●      Controllable Simplification



●      Text Complexity Assessment



●      Corpora, Lexical Resources, Benchmarks for Text Simplification



●      Studies on Text Simplification Evaluation



●      Assistive Technologies for improving readability and comprehension including those going beyond text



●      Domain Specific Text Simplification (e.g. health, legal)



●      Other Related topics in Text Simplification (e.g. eye-tracking simplification studies)



 



We invite long papers (8 pages) and short papers and demos (4 pages). Both long and short papers and demos have unlimited references, and their final versions will be given one additional page (up to 9 and 5 pages, respectively, in the proceedings and unlimited pages for references).



CTTS-2021 uses a double-blind reviewing process. Papers must conform to the official CEUR-WS style guidelines, be in PDF format, and be submitted via the Easychair conference management system using this link: Easychair CTTS-2021 (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ctts2021)



The paper submission deadline for both long and short workshop paper, and demo description is 22nd June, 2021.



Multiple submissions policy: Multiple submissions are allowed, but the authors should indicate clearly whether they have submitted or plan to submit a paper with the same content to another venue.



Templates, guidelines and other policies: The CEUR-ART paper style with 1-Colum will be used. An Overleaf page for LaTeX users is available at https://www.overleaf.com/read/gwhxnqcghhdt. You can also download an offline version with the style files from ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip.

    INVITED SPEAKER

      Kevin Knight, Information Sciences Institute, USC

      ""Putting a Value on Comparable Data""



============================================================



MOTIVATION

In the language engineering and the linguistics communities,

research in comparable corpora has been motivated by two main

reasons. In language engineering, it is chiefly motivated by the

need to use comparable corpora as training data for statistical

NLP applications such as statistical machine translation or

cross-lingual retrieval. In linguistics, on the other hand,

comparable corpora are of interest in themselves by making

possible inter-linguistic discoveries and comparisons. It is

generally accepted in both communities that comparable corpora

are documents in one or several languages that are comparable in

content and form in various degrees and dimensions. We believe

that the linguistic definitions and observations related to

comparable corpora can improve methods to mine such corpora for

applications of statistical NLP. As such, it is of great interest

to bring together builders and users of such corpora.



Parallel corpora are a key resource as training data for

statistical machine translation, and for building or extending

bilingual lexicons and terminologies. However, beyond a few

language pairs such as English-French or English-Chinese and a

few contexts such as parliamentary debates or legal texts, they

remain a scarce resource, despite the creation of automated

methods to collect parallel corpora from the Web. Interest in

non-parallel forms of comparable corpora in language engineering

primarily ensued from the scarcity of parallel corpora. This has

motivated research concerning the use of comparable corpora:

pairs of monolingual corpora selected according to the same set

of criteria, but in different languages or language varieties.

Non-parallel yet comparable corpora overcome the two limitations

of parallel corpora, since sources for original, monolingual

texts are much more abundant than translated texts. However,

because of their nature, mining translations in comparable

corpora is much more challenging than in parallel corpora. What

constitutes a good comparable corpus, for a given task or per se,

also requires specific attention: while the definition of a

parallel corpus is fairly straightforward, building a

non-parallel corpus requires control over the selection of source

texts in both languages.



With the advent of online data, the potential for building and

exploring comparable corpora is growing exponentially. Comparable

documents in languages that are very different from each other

pose special challenges as very often, the non-parallelness in

sentences can result from cultural and political differences.

In natural languages, there are many ways to express complex human thoughts and ideas. This can be achieved by exploiting compositionality, i.e. concatenating simplex elements of language and thus yielding a more complex meaning that can be computed from the meaning of the original parts and the way they are combined. However, non-compositional phrases are also very frequent in any human language. These complex phrases can often be decomposed into single meaningful units, but the meaning of the whole phrase cannot (or can only partially) be computed from the meaning of its parts. Such phrases are often called multiword expressions (MWEs) and display lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and/or statistical idiosyncrasies (Baldwin & Kim 2010). In addition to idiomatic constructions, MWEs encompass closely related linguistic constructs such as light verb constructions, rhetorical figures and institutionalized phrases or collocations (Sag et al. 2002). MWEs pose problems for linguistic processing, especially in language learning and natural language processing (NLP), for instance, in machine translation, syntactic and semantic parsing, just to name a few applications. 



Researchers from several disciplines such as computer science, linguistics and psychology have been jointly working on MWE modeling and processing. For instance, designing guidelines for the annotation of MWEs in corpora, and prominently in treebanks, has been undertaken in various languages and linguistic frameworks (Rosén et al. 2015). Lexical resources with MWEs in dozens of languages exist and are still being developed (Losnegaard et al. 2016). Many papers describe methods to discover new MWEs in texts, applying a wide variety of tools and techniques such as association measures, distributional methods and machine learning. Interactions of MWE processing with deeper levels of linguistic analysis, notably parsing and semantic processing, are being increasingly investigated (e.g. in SEMEVAL 2016 task 10 - DiMSUM). Special issues on MWEs have been published by leading journals (CSL in 2005, LR&E in 2010, ACM TSLP in 2013). Several funded projects focusing on MWEs are indicative of the growing importance of the field within the NLP community. For instance, the EU H2020 program currently supports the COST Action PARSEME (2013-2017), that addresses the role of MWEs in parsing and gathers more than 200 researchers from 33 countries covering 30 languages. It also inspired several national spin-off projects on MWEs.



Many of these advances are described and published in the annual MWE workshop. It attracts the attention of an ever-growing community working on a variety of languages and linguistic phenomena. The workshop has been held since 2001 in conjunction with major computational linguistics conferences (ACL, COLING, LREC, EACL). It represents an important venue for the community to interact, share resources and tools, and collaborate on efforts for advancing the computational treatment of MWEs. 



We invite papers on major challenges in MWE processing, both from theoretical and computational viewpoints, focusing on research related (but not limited) to the following topics: 



Manually and automatically constructed lexical resources

MWE representation in lexical resources

MWE annotation in corpora and treebanks

MWEs in non-standard language (e.g. tweets, forums, spontaneous speech)

Original MWE discovery methods (e.g. using word embeddings, parallel corpora)

Original MWE in-context identification methods (e.g. using deep learning, topic models)

MWE processing in syntactic frameworks (e.g. HPSG, LFG, TAG, universal dependencies)

MWE processing in semantic frameworks (e.g. WSD, semantic parsing)

MWE processing in end-user applications (e.g. summarization, machine translation)

Orchestration of MWE processing with respect to applications

Evaluation of MWE processing techniques

Models of first and second language acquisition of MWEs

Theoretical and psycholinguistic studies on MWEs

Crosslinguistic studies on MWEs 



A volume with selected papers from the workshop is planned within the book series Phraseology and MultiWord Expressions that is the MWE-dedicated book series of Language Science Press.  



SPECIAL TRACK: Shared task on automatic identification of verbal MWEs

This year, there will be an extension to the traditional workshop: a special track for shared task papers. The shared task will compare and evaluate systems for the automatic identification of verbal MWEs in sentences. Participants will have the opportunity to submit shared task system description papers and present their approach and results at the workshop. For more details, see the separate call for shared task participation: http://multiword.sourceforge.net/sharedtask2017/



SUBMISSION MODALITIES 

Main track sessions:

Long papers (8 content pages + references): Long papers should report on solid and finished research including new experimental results, resources and/or techniques.

Short papers (4 content pages + references): Short papers should report on small experiments, focused contributions, ongoing research, negative results and/or philosophical discussion.



Shared task track would feature system description papers:

System description papers (4 content pages + references): System description papers briefly describe the approach implemented to solve the problem. They may include references and links to more detailed descriptions in other documents.

There is no limit on the number of reference pages. Authors will be granted an extra page for the final version of their papers.



For the main track, submission will be double-blind, the reported research should be substantially original and the papers will be presented orally or as posters. The decision as to which papers will be presented orally and which as posters will be made by the program committee based on the nature rather than on the quality of the work. 

The shared task system description papers will go through a separate reviewing process. Like in SEMEVAL, submissions will be double-blind and will be reviewed by the shared task organizers and participants according to the schedule below. The selected papers will be presented as posters. Participants of the shared task are not required to submit system description papers, and their acceptance depends on the quality of the paper rather than on the results obtained in the shared task.



For all types of submission, the EACL 2017 LaTeX templates should be used. In accordance to EACL 2017 submission policy, this is a condition for accepting the paper for the reviewing process. Final versions of accepted papers will be submitted both in PDF and source LaTeX formats. Templates can be retrieved from:

MOTIVATION



In the language engineering and the linguistics communities,

research in comparable corpora has been motivated by two main

reasons. In language engineering, it is chiefly motivated by the

need to use comparable corpora as training data for statistical

NLP applications such as statistical machine translation or

cross-lingual retrieval. In linguistics, on the other hand,

comparable corpora are of interest in themselves by making

possible inter-linguistic discoveries and comparisons. It is

generally accepted in both communities that comparable corpora

are documents in one or several languages that are comparable in

content and form in various degrees and dimensions. We believe

that the linguistic definitions and observations related to

comparable corpora can improve methods to mine such corpora for

applications of statistical NLP. As such, it is of great interest

to bring together builders and users of such corpora.



The scarcity of parallel corpora has motivated research concerning

the use of comparable corpora: pairs of monolingual corpora selected

according to the same set of criteria, but in different languages

or language varieties. Non-parallel yet comparable corpora overcome

the two limitations of parallel corpora, since sources for original,

monolingual texts are much more abundant than translated texts.

However, because of their nature, mining translations in comparable

corpora is much more challenging than in parallel corpora. What

constitutes a good comparable corpus, for a given task or per se,

also requires specific attention: while the definition of a parallel

corpus is fairly straightforward, building a non-parallel corpus

requires control over the selection of source texts in both languages.



Parallel corpora are a key resource as training data for statistical

machine translation, and for building or extending bilingual lexicons

and terminologies. However, beyond a few language pairs such as English-

French or English-Chinese and a few contexts such as parliamentary debates

or legal texts, they remain a scarce resource, despite the creation of

automated methods to collect parallel corpora from the Web. To exemplify

such issues in a practical setting, this year's special focus will be on



   Language Resources for Machine Translation

   in Less-Resourced Languages and Domains



with the aim of overcoming the shortage of parallel resources

when building MT systems for less-resourced languages and domains,

particularly by usage of comparable corpora for finding parallel data

within and by reaching out for ""hidden"" parallel data. Lack of sufficient

language resources for many language pairs and domains is currently one

of the major obstacles in further advancement of machine translation.

The 14th Annual Workshop of the Australian Language Technology Association (ALTA 2016) will be held on the 5th and 6th of December at Caulfield campus of Monash University, colocated with the Australian Document Computing Symposium. 

The ALTA 2016 workshop is the key local forum for socialising research results in natural language processing and computational linguistics, with presentations and posters from student, industry, and early-career researchers. 



The workshop also features invited keynote speakers and panelists and a shared task that encourages promising students to get involved in language technology research. 





# Format  



We invite submissions of two different formats: 





## Original Research Papers 



We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all aspects of natural language processing. Long papers should be 6-8 pages. Accepted long papers will have a 15 minute slot for oral presentation plus 5 minutes for questions and discussion. Short papers should be 3-4 pages. Accepted short papers will have a poster presentation plus a short approx. 5 minute talk to advertise the poster. Both formats may include up to 2 pages of references additional to these page count requirements. Note that the review process is double-blind, and accordingly submitted papers should not include the author identity and the text should be suitably anonymised, e.g., using third person wording for self-citations, not providing URLs to your person website, etc. 



Original research papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which will be published online in the ACL anthology and the ALTA website. Long papers will be distinguished from short papers in the proceedings. 





## Presentations 



To encourage broader participation and facilitate local socialisation of international results, we continue the presentations format introduced last year. We invite submissions of 1-2 page presentation abstracts. These will not be published in the proceedings, but simply reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to ensure that they are on topic, coherent and likely to be of interest to the ALTA community. Abstracts on work in progress and work published or submitted elsewhere are encouraged. ALTA invites submissions of all manner interesting research, not limited to, but including: 



- established academics giving an overview of an exciting paper or paper/s published in international venues; 

- completing research students giving an overview of their thesis work; 

- early candidature research students presenting their work-in-progress and ideas, which may not have been published; and 

industry presenting research and development over linguistic data in the context of their business. 



Presentation abstracts should not be anonymised, any publications relating to the work should be cited in the submission, and the person who will give the presentation should be clearly stated. Successful submissions will have a 15 or 30 minute slot for an oral presentation. Please nominate what length presentation you would prefer in your submission. 



# Topics 

ALTA invites the submission of papers and presentations on all aspects of natural language processing, including, but not limited to: 



- phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse;

The first deadline for submissions to the new ACL Rolling Review system is 15 May 2021, and the deadline will be the 15th of each month thereafter. For the link to each month's submission site, please see https://aclrollingreview.org/authors.



ACL Rolling Review (ARR)  invites the submission of long and short papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. The purpose of ARR is to improve efficiency and turnaround of ACL reviewing while keeping the diversity (topical, geographic and otherwise)  and editorial freedom that we value about our current organization of the reviewing process at ACL venues. ARR  will use Open Review as its platform (but reviews will not be open in ARR).

The reviewing and acceptance of papers for publication will be done in two steps:

* Step 1 -- Centralized Rolling Review: Authors submit papers to a unified review pool with deadline on the 15th of each month. Review is handled by an action editor, and revision and resubmission of papers is allowed.

* Step 2 -- Submission to Publication Venue: A publication venue is a conference or workshop that participates in ARR. When an opportunity to submit to a

publication venue comes around, authors may submit already reviewed papers with reviews to the publication venue, through the OpenReview website. Program chairs (possibly with the help of senior area chairs) will then accept a subset of submitted papers for presentation.

 

## SUBMISSIONS



Relevant topics for ARR include, but are not limited to, the following areas (in alphabetical order):

* Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics

* Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing



In addition, ARR welcomes submissions related to special Themes proposed by participating publication venues.



## PAPER SUBMISSION INFORMATION



### Long Papers



Long papers must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included.

Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited pages of references.

   

### Short Papers



Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages. Some kinds of short papers are:

 

* A small, focused contribution

* A negative result

* An opinion piece

* An interesting application nugget

* Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited pages of references.

 

### Anonymity Period

 

ACL has policies for submission, review and citation (https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Policies_for_Submission,_Review_and_Citation) designed to protect the integrity of two-way anonymized review and ensure that submissions are reviewed fairly. A paper can only be (re)submitted to ARR if it has been anonymous for at least a month before the first submission, and it must remain anonymous while it is under review.

 

* Authors may allow their anonymized submission to be publicly available on OpenReview while it is under ARR review.

* Authors may not make a non-anonymized version of their paper available online to the general community (for example, via a preprint server) during the anonymity period. By a version of a paper,  we mean another paper having essentially the same scientific content but possibly differing in minor details (including title and structure) and/or in length.

* If the authors have posted a non-anonymized version of their paper online before the start of the anonymity period, they may submit an anonymized version to ARR. The submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version, and the authors must inform the editors in chief that a non-anonymized version exists.

* Authors may not update the non-anonymized version during the anonymity period, and we ask authors not to advertise it on social media or take other actions that would further compromise two-way anonymized reviewing during the anonymity period.

* Note that, while authors are not prohibited from making a non-anonymous version available online before the start of the anonymity period, this does make two-way anonymized reviewing more difficult to maintain, and we therefore encourage authors to wait. Alternatively, authors may consider submitting your work to the Computational Linguistics journal, which does not require anonymization and has a track for “short” (i.e., conference-length) papers.



### Instructions for Two-Way Anonymized Review



Papers must not include authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the authors’ identities, e.g., ""We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."" must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ""Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."" Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.



Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents that are not available to the reviewers.



Supplementary materials should also be anonymized.



### Authorship



The author list for submissions should include all (and only) individuals who made substantial contributions to the work presented. Each author listed on a submission to ARR will be notified of submissions and reviews.



### Citation and Comparison



Authors are expected to cite all refereed publications relevant to your submission, but may be excused for not knowing about all unpublished work (especially work that has been recently posted and/or is not widely cited).



In cases where a preprint has been superseded by a refereed publication, the refereed publication should be cited in addition to or instead of the preprint version.



Papers (whether refereed or not) appearing less than 3 months before the submission deadline are considered contemporaneous to a submission, and authors are therefore not obliged to make detailed comparisons that require additional experimentation and/or in-depth analysis.



For more information, see the ACL Policies for Submission, Review, and Citation (https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Policies_for_Submission,_Review_and_Citation).



### Multiple Submission Policy



ARR precludes multiple submissions. ARR will not consider any paper that is under review in a journal or another conference at the time of submission, and submitted papers must not be submitted elsewhere during the ARR review period. This policy covers all journals and refereed and archival conferences and workshops without exception  (e.g., TACL, Computational Linguistics, IJCAI, SIGIR, AAAI, ICASSP, ICML, Neurips, etc).

In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere, without exception.  



### Ethics Policy



Authors are required to honour the ethical code set out in the [ACL Code of Ethics](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-code-ethics).



The consideration of the ethical impact of our research, use of data, and potential applications of our work has always been an important consideration, and as artificial intelligence is becoming more mainstream, these issues are increasingly pertinent. We ask that all authors read the code, and ensure that their work is conformant to this code. Where a paper may raise ethical issues, we ask that authors include in the paper an explicit discussion of these issues, which will be taken into account in the review process. We reserve the right to reject papers on ethical grounds, where the authors are judged to have operated counter to the code of ethics, or have inadequately addressed legitimate ethical concerns with their work. Indeed, the ARR review form includes a section addressing these issues and papers flagged for ethical concerns by reviewers or action editors will be further reviewed by the Ethics Advisory Committee (EAC).



Authors are encouraged to devote a section of their paper to concerns of the ethical impact of the work and to a discussion of broader impacts of the work.



### Submission Criteria



ARR will provide a submission checklist that authors will be asked to answer during paper submission. The checklist is intended as a reminder to help authors improve the quality of their papers. The author instruction on the checklist will be available Coming soon.



### Paper Submission and Templates



Submission is electronic, using the OpenReview.net platform. All long, short and theme papers must follow the ACL Author Guidelines (https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Author_Guidelines). 

 

Paper submissions must use the official ACL style templates, which are available as an Overleaf template (https://www.overleaf.com/read/crtcwgxzjskr) and also downloadable directly (https://github.com/acl-org/ACLPUB/tree/master/templates)  (Latex and Word). Please follow the paper formatting guidelines general to ""\*ACL"" conferences available at https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html.

Authors may not modify these style files or use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.

  

### Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data



ARR encourages the submission of these supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results, and to enable authors to provide additional information that does not fit in the paper. Supplementary materials may include appendices, software or data. For example, pre processing  decisions, model parameters, feature templates, lengthy proofs or derivations, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of the work described in the paper can be put into appendices. However, if the pseudo-code or derivations or model specifications are an important part of the contribution, or if they are important for the reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work, they should be a part of the main paper, and not appear in appendices. Reviewers are not required to consider material in appendices.



Appendices should come after the references in the submitted pdf, but do not count towards the page limit. Software should be submitted as a single .tgz or .zip archive, and data as a separate single .tgz or .zip archive. Supplementary materials must be fully anonymized to preserve the two-way anonymized reviewing policy."

March 30 - April 3, 2009

Athens, Greece

URL: http://www.eacl2009.gr





Submission deadline: October 10, 2008





EACL 2009 is the 12th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association

for Computational Linguistics. The conference invites the submission of

papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research on all aspects of

computational linguistics, including, but not limited to:



- phonetics, phonology, and morphology;

- spoken language processing and language modeling;

- word segmentation, tagging, and chunking;

- syntax, parsing, and grammar formalisms;

- lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation;

- compositional semantics and textual entailment;

- pragmatics, discourse, and dialogue;

- lexicon, lexical databases, and ontologies;

- generation and summarization;

- information retrieval, question answering, and information extraction;

- machine translation and multilingual systems;

- dialogue systems and multimodal systems;

- language resources and tools, and resources for lesser studied languages;

- linguistic, psychological, and mathematical models of language;

- machine learning and algorithms for natural language;

- evaluation methodology.





Requirements



Papers should describe original work; they should emphasize completed work

rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of

completion of the reported results. A paper accepted for presentation at

EACL 2009 cannot be presented or have been presented at any other meeting

with publicly available published proceedings. Papers that are being

submitted to other conferences or workshops must indicate this on the

submission page.





Review and Selection



Reviewing of papers will be double-blind, and all submissions will receive

three independent reviews. Final decisions on the program will be made by

the Program Committee, consisting of the Program Co-Chairs and Area Chairs.

Submissions will be assessed with respect to appropriateness, clarity,

soundness/correctness, meaningful comparison, originality/innovativeness,

and impact of ideas or results. For more information about the review

criteria, see the review form appended below.





Publication and Presentation



All papers that are accepted will be published in the proceedings of the

conference, and will be presented as a poster or an oral presentation.

Authors will be asked on submission to state their preferred mode of

presentation, and the program committee will attempt to fulfill as many

of these preferences as possible, organizational factors permitting.

EACL 2009 will additionally aim to give poster presentations higher

status than usual (by scheduling, physical arrangement, combination with

refreshments). The proceedings will not distinguish long papers by

presentation format.





Submission Information



All submissions must be electronic in PDF and must follow the two-column

format of EACL proceedings. Authors are strongly recommended to use the

style files available on the conference web site. The maximum length of

a manuscript is eight (8) pages of content and one (1) additional page

of references. The page limits have to be strictly observed.



As reviewing will be double-blind, the paper should not include the

authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal

the author's identity, e.g., ""We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."",

should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ""Smith previously

showed (Smith, 1991) ..."". (Do not use anonymous citations.) Do not

include acknowledgments. Papers that do not conform to these requirements

will be rejected without review.



The deadline for submission is 23:59 CET on October 10, 2008. Additional

instructions for electronic submission will be posted on the conference

website at http://www.eacl2009.gr.

Translatology is the theoretical and practical study of translation. It combines insights from linguistics, the humanities, cognitive and computer science to understand the process of translating between languages and the particular features characterizing language in translation. Central concepts of contemporary translatology are translationese, linguistic patterns that tend to make translations more similar to each other than to texts originally written in their target language; and variation, which refers to the fact that different types of translations, such as written translations vs. interpreting, display systematic linguistic differences. 



The Workshop on Modelling Translation: Translatology in the Digital Age seeks to facilitate collaboration and knowledge exchange between researchers in linguistics, AI, CL, NLP, translation studies, cognitive and computer science focusing on modeling translation from diverse angles, such as variation in translation, machine translation, translation quality assessment and translationese. Specifically, the workshop aims to foster innovative research at the intersection between machine and human translation modeling by applying concepts from translation studies to machine translation or using machine translation techniques to explore research questions in translatology. We encourage research on modeling aspects of translation, including word embeddings, neural or statistical machine translation, feature-based text classification, syntactic and semantic parsing, monolingual or multilingual language models, text generation, and stylometry.



We invite papers on all relevant research areas, including but not limited to:



Translationese detection and analysis through quantitative means

Improving understanding of translation in the context of NLP

Analysis and interpretation of variation in translation

Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of translation models

Contextualized and multimodal translation analysis

Computational semantics and pragmatics applied to translation studies

Sentiment and emotion analysis of translations

Human translation quality assessment and evaluation

Cognitive and computational insights of variation in translation and translationese 

Computational models of translation types such as communicative translation, semantic translation, transcreation.

Presentation of new corpora for translation studies, such as literary translation corpora, interpreting transcript datasets.

Translation and Post-editing interfaces

Cognitive modeling of translation processes, including cognitive load measurements 

We welcome all kinds of contributions addressing the topics mentioned above.

INTRODUCTION 

 

The Text Analysis Conference (TAC) is a series of evaluations and workshops organized to promote research in Natural Language Processing and related applications, by providing a large test collection, common evaluation procedures, and a forum for organizations to share their results. NIST provides test data for each task, and participants run their NLP systems on the data and return their results to NIST for evaluation. The conference culminates in a November workshop at NIST in Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA. 

You are invited to participate in TAC 2012. Organizations may choose to participate in any or all of the TAC 2012 tasks. All results submitted to NIST are archived on the TAC web site, and all evaluations of submitted results are included in the conference proceedings. Dissemination of TAC work and results other than in the conference proceedings is welcomed, but the conditions of participation specifically 

preclude any advertising claims based on TAC results. 



TASKS 	

  

TAC KBP 2012 Overview



TAC 2012 focuses on Knowledge Base Population (KBP). The goal of Knowledge Base Population is to promote research in automated systems that discover information about named entities as found in a large corpus and incorporate this information into a knowledge base. TAC 2012 fields tasks in three areas, all aimed at improving the ability to automatically populate knowledge bases from text:



Entity-Linking: Given a name (of a Person, Organization, or Geopolitical Entity) and a document containing that name, determine the KB node for the named entity, adding a new node for the entity if it is not already in the KB. The reference KB is derived from English Wikipedia, while source documents come from a variety of languages, including English, Chinese, and Spanish.

Slot-Filling: Given a named entity and a pre-defined set of attributes (""slots"") for the entity type, augment a KB node for that entity by extracting all new learnable slot values for the entity as found in a large corpus of documents. The reference KB is derived from English Wikipedia, while source documents come from English and Spanish. A diagnostic task, Slot Filler Validation, will be to determine whether a candidate filler in a document is a correct slot-filler for a given entity.

Cold Start Knowledge Base Population: Given a KB schema with an empty knowledge base, build the KB from scratch by mining a large text collection.

To promote research in populating probabilistic knowledge bases, systems may augment each assertion they make with a confidence score.



  KBP track coordinators: 	

   •  James  Mayfield	  (james.mayfield@jhuapl.edu)    	

   •  Javier Artiles	  ( javier.artiles@mail.rakuten.com )	

  	

   REGISTRATION 

Organizations wishing to participate in any of the TAC 2012 tasks are invited to register online by June 10, 2012. Participants are advised to register and submit all required agreement forms as soon as possible in order to receive timely access to evaluation resources, including any sample and training data. Registration for a task does not commit you to participating in the task, but is helpful to know for planning. 

Late registration will be permitted only if resources allow. Any questions about conference participation may be sent to the TAC project manager: tac-manager@nist.gov.

WORKSHOP 

The TAC 2012 workshop will be held November 5-6, 2012, in Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA. The workshop is a forum both for presentation of results (including failure analyses and system comparisons), and for more lengthy system presentations describing techniques used, experiments run on the data, and other issues of interest to researchers in Information Extraction and NLP. KBP task participants who wish to give a presentation during the workshop will submit a short abstract in September describing the experiments they performed. As there is a limited amount of time for oral presentations, the abstracts will be used to determine which participants are asked to speak and which will present in a poster session.

Title of the workshop:

Language Diversity and the Acquisition of Linguistic Semantic Knowledge



The host conference:

6th International Conference on Multimedia and Network Information Systems, Wroclaw, Poland, September 18-19, 2008 



Web site:

http://www.zsi.pwr.wroc.pl/MISSI2008/LDALSK/

       

The proportion of Web pages written in English keeps decreasing, but a majority of text-handling tools and techniques have been developed for English and tested on English resources. Many languages have been reasonably well served by the existing systems, but large typological differences (complex morphology, rich inflection, freer-order syntax, not to mention cultural biases) tend to make those tools and resources less than fully adequate. This may be particularly true of deeper processing, including the acquisition of natural language semantics from text.



The workshop seeks to explore methodologies developed from scratch for a variety of languages, and perhaps their reapplication to the processing of English texts. We invite submissions on the topics we list below, and on closely related topics in the general spirit of the workshop. We target the problem of  automatic extraction of some form of natural language semantics from corpora and application of the knowledge extracted in that way in systems that deal with  natural language. 



Work on any language is welcome; we particularly encourage submissions related to ""less privileged"" languages. The workshop will be held in English, to ensure the broadest dissemination of its contributions. We have room for up to 50 papers, including posters, so there will be ample opportunity to report on work in progress. To suit the host conference, papers on applications of the semantic knowledge extracted from text will also be considered; such applications include 

machine translation, parsing, sentiment analysis, information retrieval, information extraction, and text mining.



All submissions must present original work. There will be a strict reviewing process. (Submission instructions will be announced later.) The proceedings will be printed by IEEE.



Topics:



Distributional semantics, semantic relatedness, semantic similarity

Extraction of lexico-semantic relations

Extraction of logical models for natural language semantics

Extraction of selectional restrictions

Lexicon extraction from corpora

Pattern-based methods in lexical knowledge acquisition

Recognition of expressions of opinions and emotions in text

Resources and tools for word-sense disambiguation

Software support for lexical knowledge acquisition

Thesaurus construction, extension and critique



Schedule:

 Related Formalisms (TAG+10)



 10-12 June 2010

 Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA



 CALL FOR PAPERS



 The Workshop on Tree-Adjoining Grammars and related formalisms (TAG+)

 is a biennial workshop series that fosters exchange of ideas among

 linguists, psycholinguists and computer scientists interested in

 modeling natural language using formal grammars. The workshop series,

 since 1990, has demonstrated productive interactions among

 researchers and practitioners interested in various aspects of the

 Tree-Adjoining Grammar formalism and its relationship to other

 grammar formalisms, such as combinatory categorial grammar,

 dependency grammars, Minimalist grammars, HPSG, and LFG; hence the

 ``+'' in the name of the workshop.  These discussions have helped

 identify similarities and differences between formalisms, led to

 the shared development of broad-coverage grammars, transfer of

 parsing and machine learning algorithms from one formalism to another

 and to new insights into the properties of different formalisms and

 their capacity for linguistic explanation.



 Tree-Adjoining Grammars (TAG) and related lexicalized grammar

 formalisms provide mathematical tools to model natural language and

 the scaffolding to encode linguistic generalizations in a principled

 manner. Additionally, these lexicalized representations offer strong

 and unique underpinnings for computational models of language,

 complementing the present day predominance of statistical models. The

 linguistic and mathematical sophistication of these formalisms in

 conjunction with the computational grammars that have been

 implemented for many languages offer an unprecedent resource to

 practitioners in natural language processing and machine learning

 communities. It is our expectation that this workshop will enable

 cross-fertilization of ideas that combine the representational

 flexibility of TAG-like grammar formalisms with the robustness

 afforded by machine learning techniques to produce a deeper insight

 into modeling natural language.



 The first day of the workshop will be devoted to a series of

 tutorials, designed to introduce participants to a range of aspects of

 TAG and related formalisms.  Currently planned tutorials include

 Formal Aspects of Mildly Context-Sensitive Grammars, Syntax and TAG,

 Semantics and TAG, Parsing with TAG, Machine Learning of Syntactic

 Structure.



 We especially welcome the participation of student researchers in this

 workshop, both from the TAG community and beyond, and expect to be

 able to provide funding for students with accepted paper to attend the

 tutorials and workshop.





 Topics of Interest:



 We invite submissions on all aspects of TAG and related grammatical

 formalisms including the following topics:



 * syntactic and semantic theory;

 * mathematical properties;

 * computational and algorithmic studies of parsing, interpretation and

language generation;

 * machine learning models using TAG-like representations;

 * corpus-based research and grammar development using TAG;

 * psycholinguistic modeling; and

 * applications to natural language processing or biological sequence

modeling.



Submission Details:



 Anonymous abstracts may be submitted for two types  of presentations

 at the workshop: oral presentations and poster presentations.

 Poster presentations are particularly appropriate for brief

 descriptions of specialized implementations, resources under

 development and work in progress.



 Regardless of the type of submission, abstracts may not exceed two

 pages in length (not including data, figures and references).  Both

 one-column or two-column abstracts are permissible. However do not

 use a font that is smaller than 11pt. If you are using LaTeX for

 document preparation, then any recent ACL style file can be used. The

 final camera ready version of the full paper for the proceedings must

 be in two-column format conforming to the most recent ACL style file.



 Proceedings including full papers for accepted abstracts (including

 both oral and poster presentations) will be available on-line and at

 the workshop. In addition, we will explore possibilities for

 subsequent publication of workshop articles.



 Important dates:



 * Deadline for submission of abstracts: March 15, 2010.

 * Notification to authors of decision: April 19, 2010.

 * Deadline for camera-ready submission: May 3, 2010.

 * Workshop dates: June 10 to 12, 2010.

The study of dialogue investigates how natural language is used in interaction between interlocutors and how coordination and successful communication is achieved. Dialogue is multimodal, situated and embodied, with non-linguistic factors such as attention, eye gaze and gesture critical to understanding communication. However, studies on dialogue have often taken for granted that we align our perceptual representations, which are taken to be part of common ground (grounding in dialogue, Clark, 1996). They have also typically remained silent about how we integrate information from different sources and modalities and the different contribution of each of these. These assumptions are unsustainable when we consider interactions between agents with obviously different perceptual capabilities, as is the case in dialogues between humans and artificial agents, such as avatars or robots.

 

Contrarily, studies of perception have focussed on how an agent interacts with and interprets the information from their perceptual environment. There is significant research on how language is grounded in perception, how words are connected to perceptual representations and agent’s actions and therefore assigned meaning (grounding in action and perception, Harnad, 1990). In the last decade there has been impressive progress on integrated approaches to language, action, and perception, especially with the introduction of deep learning methods in the field of image descriptions that use end-to-end training from data. However, these have a limited integration to the dynamics of dialogue and often fail to take into account the incremental and context sensitive nature of language and the environment.

 

The aim of this collection is to initiate a genuine dialogue between these related areas and to examine different approaches from computational, linguistic and psychological perspectives and how these can inform each other.

 

We invite papers of between 8-12 pages of content and up to two additional pages for references, following the ACL style guidelines.

1. ENLG 2015

-------------

The ENLG 2015 workshop is the latest in a biennial series of workshops 

on Natural Language Generation (NLG) started in 1987, providing a 

regular forum for presentation of research in this area, both for NLG 

specialists and for researchers from related areas. ENLG is endorsed by 

the ACL Special Interest Group on Generation (SIGGEN). The 2015 edition 

will be held at the University of Brighton, UK, and will be co-organised 

by COST Action IC1307: The European Network on Vision and Language (iV&L 

Net).



As always, ENLG welcomes submissions in all areas of, and approaches to, 

NLG: from specific tasks to complete solutions, and from rule-based to 

statistical and machine learning methods. For this edition, the special 

theme will be Image and Video Description; as well as the usual ENLG 

topics we therefore especially invite submissions in this and related areas.





2. Call for papers and demos

------------------------------

ENLG 2015 invites substantial, original, and unpublished submissions on 

all topics related to natural language generation. Given the special 

theme of ENGL'15, we particularly encourage submissions, in any of the 

three categories (long, short and demo papers), on the automatic 

generation of image and video descriptions. Topics of interest include, 

but are not limited to:



- Content and text planning

- Generation for affect and emotion

- Generation for embodied agents and robots

- Evaluation of NLG systems

- Data-to-text generation

- Lexicalisation

- Multimedia or multimodal generation

- Story-telling and narrative generation

- NLG for real-world applications

- NLG in linguistically motivated frameworks

- Personalization and personality of text

- Psycholinguistics and NLG

- Referring expression generation

- Surface realization

- Machine learning approaches to NLG tasks

- Text-to-text generation and summarisation

- NLG techniques for paraphrase generation

- NLG techniques for abstractive summarisation

- Generation of image and video descriptions



We also invite submissions for system demonstrations. Demo papers should 

describe implemented systems, which will be presented during demo 

sessions throughout the duration of the workshop.





3. Submission and format

-------------------------

ENLG has three submission categories, long and short papers, and demo 

papers:

- Long papers are most appropriate for presenting substantial research 

results and must not exceed eight (8) pages of content, with up to two 

additional pages for references (these will be orally presented);

- Short papers are more appropriate for presenting an ongoing research 

effort and must not exceed four (4) pages, including references (these 

will be presented as posters during the poster session).

- Demo papers should be no more than two pages in length, including 

references, and should describe implemented systems which are of 

relevance to the NLG community. Demo papers will be included in the 

proceedings. Authors of demo papers should be willing to present a demo 

of their system during ENLG 2015.



The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. Submissions 

should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings. Use of the ACL 

style files (available from http://acl2015.org/call_for_papers.html) is 

strongly recommended, and will be required for camera-ready versions. 

Reviewing will be blind, so you should avoid identifying the authors 

within the paper.



Submissions should be uploaded to the Easychair website for the workshop 

(https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=enlg2015).

At the 25th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 2014)  

Helix Conference Centre at Dublin City University (DCU)  

23-29 August 2014



Description

-----------



Recent advances in digital storage and networking, coupled with the extension of human language technologies (HLT) into ever broader areas and the persistence of difficulties in software portability, have led to an increased focus on development and deployment of web-based infrastructures that allow users to access tools and other resources and combine them to create novel solutions that can be efficiently composed, tuned, evaluated, disseminated and consumed. This in turn engenders collaborative development and deployment among individuals and teams across the globe. It also increases the need for robust, widely available evaluation methods and tools, means to achieve interoperability of software and data from diverse sources, means to handle licensing for limited access resources distributed over the web, and, perhaps crucially, the need to develop strategies for multi-site collaborative work. 



For many decades, NLP has suffered from low software engineering standards causing a limited degree of re-usability of code and interoperability of different modules within larger NLP systems. While this did not really hamper success in limited task areas (such as implementing a parser), it caused serious problems for building complex integrated software systems, e.g., for information extraction or machine translation. This lack of integration has led to duplicated software development, work-arounds for programs written in different (versions of) programming languages, and ad-hoc tweaking of interfaces between modules developed at different sites.



In recent years, two main frameworks, UIMA and GATE, have emerged that aim to allow the easy integration of varied tools through common type systems and standardized communication methods for components analysing unstructured textual information, such as natural language. Both frameworks offer a solid processing infrastructure that allows developers to concentrate on the implementation of the actual analytics components. An increasing number of members of the NLP community have adopted one of these frameworks as a platform for facilitating the creation of reusable NLP components that can be assembled to address different NLP tasks depending on their order, combination and configuration. Analysis frameworks also reduce the problem of reproducibility of NLP results by formalising solution composition and making language processing tools shareable.



Very recently, several efforts have been devoted to the development of web service platforms for NLP. These platforms exploit the growing number of web-based tools and services available for tasks related to HLT, including corpus annotation, configuration and execution of NLP pipelines, and evaluation of results and automatic parameter tuning. These platforms can also integrate modules and pipelines from existing frameworks such as UIMA and GATE, in order to achieve interoperability with a wide variety of modules from different sources.



Many of the issues and challenges surrounding these developments have been addressed individually in particular projects and workshops, but there are ramifications that cut across all of them. We therefore feel that this is the moment to bring together participants representing the range of interests that comprise the comprehensive picture for community-driven, distributed, collaborative, web-based development and use for language processing software and resources. This includes those engaged in development of infrastructures for HLT as well as those who will use these services and infrastructures, especially for multi-site collaborative work. 





### Workshop Objectives



The overall goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for discussion of the requirements for an envisaged open “global laboratory” for HLT research and development and establish the basis of a community effort to develop and support it. To this end, the workshop will include both presentations addressing the issues and challenges of developing, deploying, and using the global laboratory for distributed and collaborative efforts and discussion that will identify next steps for moving forward, fostering community-wide awareness, and establishing and encouraging communication among the various players. 



It aims at bringing together members of the NLP community specifically users, developers or providers of components and tools for these frameworks in order to explore and discuss the opportunities and challenges in using such platforms for modern, well-engineered NLP applications.



The challenge of creating reusable and interoperable components raises particular interest and are affected by legal issues, such as potentially incompatible licenses of components and tools as well as the technical aspects of packaging and distribution of components. Also, tools are important, for example to assemble complex processing pipelines, to manage the bodies of data that are to be analysed and to visualize, explore, and further deploy the analysis results. Further challenges are involved in embedding framework based analysis within applications or using it in distributed computing scenarios, such as deployment of and access to required resources. Finally, the preservation of analysis results, their provenance and reproducibility are of particular interest to the scientific user community.



### Topics



Workshop topics include, but are not limited to:



- processing of very large data collections: scale-out, parallelization, and performance optimization

- advanced applications driven by an NLP framework

- sophisticated tools to build and manage complex processing pipelines

- analysis of results: exploration, evaluation, visualization, and statistical analysis

- experience reports combining components from different sources, as well as solutions to interoperability issues

- experience reports combining different frameworks (e.g. GATE/UIMA/WebLicht/etc.)

- UIMA components with a special focus on genericity and type-system independence

- repositories of ready-to-use components for UIMA and/or GATE

- distribution of components: documentation, licensing and packaging

- developing for UIMA or GATE: simplified APIs, debugging, unit testing, and limitations of the frameworks

- combining annotation type systems in processing frameworks (GATE, UIMA, etc.) with standardization efforts, such as done in the ISO TC37/SC4 or TEI contexts.

- use of NLP frameworks in real-world ""industry"" settings

- reports on current projects and frameworks, their challenges and proposed or implemented solutions, including efforts to address interoperability 

- issues and challenges of multi-site collaborative projects, including reports of implemented or proposed strategies

- pipeline management, including authentication, strategies for passing resources through disparate tools and across hosting nodes, and licensing 

- development and use of evaluation environments that facilitate assessment of HLT component performance, iterative application development, and replication of results 

- community awareness and implementation of open infrastructures, including how to engage the community, establish confidence in the process, and promote use

The Association for Computational Linguistics is pleased to announce that its 2013 Annual Meeting will take place in Sofia, Bulgaria, on August 4th to 9th.



The conference invites the submission of long and short papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of automated language processing, as discussed below. As already done last year, ACL 2013 will accept papers accompanied by the resource (software or data) described in the paper. In addition to the regular review of the research quality of the paper, these papers will also be reviewed for the quality of the resource that is being made available. Papers that are submitted with accompanying software/data will receive additional credit toward the overall evaluation score, and acceptance or rejection decision will be made based on the quality of both the research and the software/data component. In addition, this year there will be an important novelty: some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted for the new Transactions of the ACL journal (http://www.transacl.org/).

Description



As a joint event, this workshop  addresses two domains – multiword expressions and Wordnets – with partly overlapping communities and research interests, but relatively divergent practices and terminologies.



Multiword expressions (MWEs) are word combinations, such as all of a sudden, a hot dog, to pay a visit or to pull one's leg, which exhibit lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and/or statistical idiosyncrasies. MWEs encompass closely related linguistic objects such as idioms, compounds, light verb constructions, rhetorical figures, institutionalised phrases or collocations. Modelling and computational aspects of MWEs have been covered by the Multiword Expression Workshop, organised over the past years by the MWE section of SIGLEX. Because of their unpredictable behavior, and most prominently their non-compositional semantics, MWEs pose special problems in linguistic modelling (e.g. treebank annotation and grammar engineering), in NLP pipelines (e.g. when their orchestration with parsing is concerned), and in end-use applications (e.g. information extraction or machine translation).



From its very beginning, Princeton WordNet has included MWEs, and linked their meanings into a shared network: talk, blab, sing, spill the beans, let the cat out of the bag, tattle, peach, babble, babble out, blab out “divulge confidential information or secrets”. Indeed, over 50% of entries in the Princeton WordNet of English are MWEs and most other wordnets have a similarly high percentage. However, MWEs are generally encoded as a string, with no internal information about syntactic structure or compositionality.  Many suggestions for richer encodings have been made but not yet widely adopted, partly because of the cost of adding richer data to already large lexicons.    



For the above reasons, the MWE and WN communities are organizing this joint event, which should allow better convergences and scientific innovation. We call for papers focusing on research related (but not limited) to the following topics. 



===========

Joint topics on MWEs and Wordnets

- Encoding MWEs in wordnets --- how can we take advantage of the existing rich structure of wordnets?

- Encoding MWEs in wordnets --- consequences for a lexical-semantic organization of MWEs

- Linking wordnets with existing MWE lexicons

- Word sense disambiguation for single-word and multiword expressions 

- Cross-wordnet and cross-language comparisons of MWEs

- MWEs in sense-annotated corpora

- Semantic relations in wordnets related to MWEs



===========

MWE-specific topics

- Computationally-applicable theoretical studies on MWEs and constructions in psycholinguistics, corpus linguistics and formal grammars

- MWE and construction annotation in corpora and treebanks

- MWE and construction representation in manually/automatically constructed lexical resources

- Processing of MWEs and constructions in syntactic and semantic frameworks (e.g. CCG, CxG, HPSG, LFG, TAG, UD, etc.), and in end-user applications (e.g. information extraction, machine translation and summarization)

- Original discovery and identification methods for MWEs and constructions

MWEs and constructions in language acquisition and in non-standard language (e.g. tweets, forums, spontaneous speech)

- Evaluation of annotation and processing techniques for MWEs and constructions 

- Retrospective comparative analyses from the PARSEME shared tasks on automatic identification of MWEs



Note that, with the intention to also perpetuate previous converging effects with the Construction Grammar community (see the LAW-MWE-CxG 2018 workshop), we extend the traditional MWE scope to include grammatical constructions.



===========

Submission modalities



There are two tracks:

- Regular research track, where the submissions must be substantially original.

- Dissemination track, which welcomes recent previously published work (or work accepted for publication), dedicated explicitly both to MWEs and WordNet.   This will be presented to encourage discussion, but only the abstract will appear in the proceedings.



The regular research track submissions should follow one of the 2 formats:

- Long papers (8 content pages + references): Long papers should report on solid and finished research including new experimental results, resources and/or techniques.

- Short papers (4 content pages + references): Short papers should report on small experiments, focused contributions, ongoing research, negative results and/or philosophical discussion. 



The decisions as to oral or poster presentations of the selected papers will be taken by the PC chairs. No distinction between papers presented orally and as posters is made in the workshop proceedings. There is no limit on the number of reference pages. Authors will be granted an extra page for the final version of their papers. The submission will be double-blind, as understood by the ACL 2019 submission policy. The reported research should be substantially original. Papers available as preprints can also be submitted provided that they fulfil the conditions defined by the new ACL Policies for Submission, Review and Citation. For both types of submissions in this track, the ACL 2019 templates should be used. 



The dissemination track submissions are not anonymous, and they should not exceed one page, including the authors' names and affiliations, the mention of the original venue, the link to the original paper and a short explanation why the paper is relevant to MWEs and Wordnets workshop. If the original paper is not publicly available, it should also be submitted in a separate .pdf file but it does not have to follow the ACL 2019 template.



All papers should be submitted via the following START space: https://www.softconf.com/acl2019/mwewn



Please choose the appropriate track (research/dissemination) and for research papers the submission modality (long/short)."

Co^2Hum aims to bring together researchers from information technology, human sciences and psychological sciences to inform on the potential of cognitive computing in the Arts and Humanities. Human sciences retain a strong presence of human decision in original research, as in the profiling of historical figures or landscapes, which in turn relies on the availability of evidence in one form or another, and therefore their systematic accumulation. With its methodological objective of bringing human-like intelligence to a number of human-based tasks, cognitive computing is being proposed as a way to bridge this gap for the human scientist. The reproduction of cognitive processes in computers can be a valuable aid to interpret and understand, for instance, the literary and linguistic phenomena that are typical of human cognition. 



Cognitive computing techniques are not only a cross-disciplinary resource but also a potential for valid support to investigation, which is still largely untrodden ground in the Humanities. 



Co^2Hum welcomes original research contributions demonstrating the application of cognitive computing techniques to the Humanities. Scholars who have conducted research or developed impactful applications are invited to submit full papers with appropriately evaluated contributions. Co^2Hum also welcomes short vision or position papers on novel challenges or approaches to existing problems.



Call for Papers: 



Topics on which contributors are invited to send proposals include, but are not limited to: 



- Computational psychological profiling of artists and authors alike. 

- Automatic identification of psychological traits of fictional figures (including fictionalised/romanced actual figures) in literature. 

- Formal models connecting sociological and psychological traits of figures in literature and visual arts. 

- Modeling of knowledge acquisition from narrative texts. 

- Quantitative (e.g. statistical, computational, machine learning) methods for cognitive analysis in literature or poetry. 

- Cognitively inspired Machine Learning for literacy and poetry. 

- Computational theories of narrative and poetry literature. 

- Computational and cognitively-inspired models for literature. 

- Identification of cultural and linguistic phenomena throughout history. 

- Computational creativity for the generation and understanding of poetry and romance. 



Submissions in all the categories mentioned above (both full and short papers) will be peer-reviewed by acknowledged researchers familiar with both scholarly communities.

    International Workshop on Lexical Resources (WoLeR)

          Ljubljana, Slovenia, August 8-12, 2011

           held in conjunction with ESSLLI 2011



         http://alpage.inria.fr/~sagot/woler2011/



               --- First Call for Papers ---

          Submission deadline: February 15, 2011

==========================================================



Lexical resources are one of the main sources of linguistic information for

research and applications in Natural Language Processing and related fields. In

recent years advances have been achieved in both symbolic aspects of lexical

resource development (lexical formalisms, rule-based tools) and statistical

techniques for the acquisition and enrichment of lexical resources, both

monolingual and multilingual. The latter have allowed for faster development of

large-scale morphological, syntactic and/or semantic resources, for widely-used

as well as resource-scarce languages. Moreover, the notion of dynamic lexicon is

used increasingly for taking into account the fact that the lexicon undergoes a

permanent evolution.



This workshop aims at sketching a large picture of the state of the art in the

domain of lexical resource modeling and development. It is also dedicated to

research on the application of lexical resources for improving corpus-based

studies and language processing tools, both in NLP and other language-related

fields, such as linguistics, translation studies and didactics.



A non-exclusive list of topics covered by this workshop is:

       • lexical resources involving information from one or more description

         levels, such as morphology, syntax (e.g. valency), semantics

         (e.g. wordnets), named entity databases and terminologies

       • models, frameworks and architectures for representing lexical

         information

       • comparing, merging and coupling lexical resources

       • (offline) acquisition of lexical information, e.g. from raw, tagged or

         parsed corpora

       • dynamic lexicons, processing of unknown words, neologisms

       • lexicons of multi-word units, idioms, derived lexemes and other complex

         lexical units

       • multilingual lexicons

       • issues specific to developing lexical resources for less-resourced

         languages

       • issues specific to developing lexical resources for issues specific to

         developing lexical resources for typologically or genetically

         (un)related languages

       • lexical resources for improving language-related research and

         applications in areas such as NLP (parsing, text generation, automatic

         translation, information extraction…), linguistic research, translation

         studies, language teaching

       • evaluation methods for lexical resources

       • issues on standardization and distribution of lexical resources



Submission Details

==================



Authors are invited to submit full papers describing original and unpublished

work. Submissions should be anonymous, and have 4 to 8 pages using the LREC

stylesheets available at

http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2010/?Author-s-Kit-and-Templates (the submission

procedure shall be provided shortly on the Workshop web page)



Each submission will be anonymously reviewed by three members of the program

committee, and possibly by additional reviewers. The accepted papers will appear

in the workshop electronic proceedings. A post-workshop publication, e.g., in

the form of an Springer LNCS/LNAI series volume, will be considered.



Workshop Format

===============



The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI participants. It will

consist of five 90-minute sessions held over five consecutive days in the first

week of ESSLLI, i.e., from August 1 to August 5, 2011. There will be 3 slots for

paper presentation and discussion per session. As usual for ESSLLI workshop, the

workshop organizer will give an introduction to the topic during the first

session. Invited talks are to be announced soon.



Further information about the workshop will be on the Workshop web page, at the

following URL: http://alpage.inria.fr/~sagot/woler2011/



Important dates

===============



Submission deadline: February 15, 2011 

Notification: April 15, 2011

Final papers for proceedings: May 9, 2011

Workshop dates: August 1-5, 2011 



Practical Information

=====================



All workshop participants including the presenters will be required to register

   The purpose of the conference series International Workshop on Computational

   Linguistics for Uralic Languages is to bring together researchers

   working on computational approaches to working with these languages.

   We accept long and short papers as well as tutorial proposals working on the following

   languages: Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian, Võro, the Sámi languages,

   Komi (Zyrian, Permyak), Mordvin (Erzya, Moksha), Mari (Hill, Meadow),

   Udmurt, Nenets (Tundra, Forest), Enets, Nganasan, Selkup, Mansi,

   Khanty, Veps, Karelian (Olonets), Karelian, Ingrian (Izhorian),

   Votic, Livonian, Ludic, and other related languages.



   All Uralic languages exhibit rich morphological structure, which

   makes processing them challenging for state-of-the-art computational

   linguistic approaches, the majority also suffer from a lack of

   resources and many are endangered.



   Research papers should be original, substantial and unpublished

   research, that can describe work-in-progress systems, frameworks,

   standards and evaluation schemes. Demos and tutorials will present

   systems and standards towards the goal of interoperability and

   unification of different projects, applications and research groups .

   Appropriate topics include (but are not limited to):

     * Parsers, analysers and processing pipelines of Uralic languages

     * Lexical databases, electronic dictionaries

     * Finished end-user applications aimed at Uralic languages, such as

       spelling or grammar checkers, machine translation or speech

       processing

     * Evaluation methods and gold standards, tagged corpora, treebanks

     * Reports on language-independent or unsupervised methods as applied to Uralic languages

     * Surveys and review articles on subjects related to computational linguistics for one or more Uralic languages

     * Any work that aims at combining efforts and reducing duplication of work

     * How to elicit activity from the language community, agitation campaigns, games with a purpose



   To maximise the possibility of reproducibility, replication and

   reuse, we particularly encourage submissions which present

   free/open-source language resources and make use of free/open-source

   software.



   One of the aims of this gathering is to avoid unnecessary duplicated

   work in field of Uralistics by establishing connections and

   interoperability standards between researchers and research groups

   working at different sites. We have also identified a serious lack of

   gold standards and evaluation metrics for all Uralic languages

   including those with national support, any work towards better

   resources in these fields will be greatly appreciated. In this year's

   edition we particularly encourage researchers of minority Uralic languages

   in Russia to participate."

For accepted proposals, first drafts of full chapters (5,000 words) are due by October 1, 2018, and final versions are due December 1, 2018. Only previously unpublished papers from authors who have already earned a doctorate will be considered. Chapters should be fully referenced and written in a scholarly style for an audience of linguists, animal communication researchers, and scientists engaged in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). 



Given that we have no examples of extraterrestrial intelligence to study, and no empirical proof that such intelligence even exists, there are significant methodological constraints on attempting to anticipate the nature of extraterrestrial language. Chapters that highlight these constraints are especially welcome. 



Authors who address possible contact between human and extraterrestrial intelligence should focus on scenarios in which contact is via radio or laser signals transmitted across interstellar space, rather than via face-to-face contact. Proposals that discuss of the possibilities and/or limitations of using natural language to communicate with extraterrestrial intelligence at interstellar distances are welcome.

INFOL @ NGUES 2017 conference from April 20 to 22, 2017 in Béja. During previous editions, several researchers (linguists and computer scientists) belonging to national and international research organizations contributed to the success of this major scientific event.



The ninth edition of INFOL @ NGUES 2017 aims to deepen research in this field in relation to recent issues. It covers several themes and mainly automatic language processing. Languages ​​are presented as complex data, given that they have specific lexical, syntactic and stylistic characteristics. Studying and analyzing these different aspects has always been one of the major concerns of the scientific community. It is faced with challenges, in perpetual evolution, which it must overcome. Indeed, with the great evolution of computer tools (hardware and software) and the development of the Internet, new applications based on automatic language processing are appearing. Hence the need to develop efficient tools to analyze and process textual data. This objective can only be achieved through close collaboration between computer scientists and linguists. It is precisely in this line that the objectives assigned to the INFOL @ NGUES 2017 conference fall."

This is even true of primarily non-textual collections, given that text is also the pervasive medium for metadata. Such applications pose new challenges for NLP research: noisy, non-standard textual or multi-modal input, historical languages, vague research concepts, multilingual parts within one document, and so on. Digital resources often have insufficient coverage; resource-intensive methods require (semi-)automatic processing tools and domain adaptation, or intense manual effort (e.g., annotation).



Literary texts bring their own problems, because navigating this form of creative expression requires more than the typical information-seeking tools. Examples of advanced tasks include the study of literature of a certain period, author or sub-genre, recognition of certain literary devices, or quantitative analysis of poetry.



NLP methods applied in this context not only need to achieve high performance, but are often applied as a first step in research or scholarly workflow. That is why it is crucial to interpret model results properly; model interpretability might be more important than raw performance scores, depending on the context.



More generally, there is a growing interest in computational models whose results can be used or interpreted in meaningful ways. It is, therefore, of mutual benefit that NLP experts, data specialists and Digital Humanities researchers who work in and across their domains get involved in the Computational Linguistics community and present their fundamental or applied research results. It has already been demonstrated how cross-disciplinary exchange not only supports work in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Cultural Heritage communities but also promotes work in the Computational Linguistics community to build richer and more effective tools and models.



Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:



          adaptation of NLP tools to Cultural Heritage, Social Sciences, Humanities and literature;

          automatic error detection and cleaning of textual data;

          complex annotation schemas, tools and interfaces;

          creation (fully- or semi-automatic) of semantic resources;

          creation and analysis of social networks of literary characters;

          discourse and narrative analysis/modelling, notably in literature;

          emotion analysis for the humanities and for literature;

          generation of literary narrative, dialogue or poetry;

          identification and analysis of literary genres;

          linking and retrieving information from different sources, media, and domains;

          modelling dialogue literary style for generation;

          modelling of information and knowledge in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Cultural Heritage;

          profiling and authorship attribution;

          search for scientific and/or scholarly literature;

          work with linguistic variation and non-standard or historical use of language.

===============

The availability and size of textual information have grown dramatically in different areas such as academic, work or individual. Emails, working papers, scientific articles or social media publications are some examples of large sources of data that are presented in natural language. This raises a challenge, since the language presents a type of unstructured data that contains ambiguity, among other properties that increase the difficulty in the processing task. In this context, there is a growing interest in improving the accessibility to information and its exploitation in different environments by companies and organizations. For all this, the applications of Natural Language Processing have become very important today.

SIMBig has become an important meeting point of computer scientists, computer engineers, software engineers, and application developers from around the world. The Applied Natural Language Processing (ANLP) track of SIMBig will provide a forum that brings both researchers and practitioners to discuss: research trends and techniques related to Natural Language Processing.



Scope and Topics

================

We plan to include all the important topics related to applied natural language processing within ANLP. The topics suitable for ANLP include, but not limited to:

- Machine Translation.

- Sentiment Analysis/Opinion Mining.

- Automatic Summarization.

- Plagiarism Detection.

- Language Detection.

- Natural Language Generation.

- Natural Language Interfaces.

- Natural Language Processing in Informal Texts.

- Question-Answering Systems.

- Content Analysis.

- Natural Language Processing for Education.

- Bio-NLP.

- Dialogue Systems.

- Information Retrieval and Extraction.

- Event Detection.

- Text Classification and Clustering.

- NLP techniques for Internet of Things.

- Multilingual NLP.

- Ontology-based NLP. 



SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

======================== 



Authors are invited to submit original and unpublished papers of research and applications for this track. Full papers should be between 5 to 10 pages (including references and figures). Papers should be written in English and submissions must be in PDF format following the instructions in Latex templates (ACL templates). 



As the reviewing is double-blind, the paper should not contain the authors' names and/or affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that may reveal the author's identity, like e.g. ""We previously showed (Melgar, 2003) ..."", should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ""Melgar previously showed (Melgar, 2003) ..."". Papers that do not conform to the requirements above are subject to be rejected without review.



Paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of the paper in the conference proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper MUST present the paper.



Paper registration and submissions to ANLP will be handled using the CMT system. The address to paper registration is https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SIMBigANLP2017/

Until recently, research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has focused predominantly on propositional aspects of meaning. For example, semantic role labeling, question answering or text mining tasks aim at extracting information of the type ""who does what, when and where''. However, understanding language involves also processing Extra-Propositional Aspects of Meaning (EPAM), such as factuality, uncertainty, or subjectivity, since the same propositional meaning can be presented in a diversity of statements. While some work on phenomena like subjectivity has been carried out in the context of sentiment processing, other phenomena like the detection of sarcasm have received less attention.



By proposing this workshop we aim at bringing together scientists working on EPAM from any area related to computational language learning and processing. By EPAM we understand aspects of meaning that cannot be captured with a propositional representation such as the output of semantic role labelers.



For instance, the meaning of the sentence in Example (1) can be represented with the proposition ADD(earthquake,further threats to the global economy), whereas representing the meaning of the sentences in Example (2) requires additional mechanisms, despite the fact that all sentences share a propositional meaning.



(1)    The earthquake adds further threats to the global economy.



(2)    Does the earthquake add further threats to the global economy?

        The earthquake adds further threats to the global economy, doesn't it?

        The earthquake does not add further threats to the global economy.

        The earthquake will never add further threats to the global economy.

        The earthquake will probably add further threats to the global economy.

        Who could (possibly) think the earthquake adds further threats to the global economy?

        The earthquake might have added further threats to the global economy.

        The last analysis shows that the earthquake will add further threats to the global economy.

        It is expected that the earthquake will add further threats to the global economy.

        It has been denied that the earthquake adds further threats to the global economy.



Some of the sentences above could also be combined in a paragraph such as (3), which shows that the same event can be presented from different perspectives, at different points in time and with different extra-propositional meanings.



(3) The main question 6 months ago was whether the earthquake would add further threats to the global economy. Some days after the earthquake the authorities were convinced that it would be possible to minimize the impact of the earthquake. Most economists didn't share this view and predicted a high economic impact of the earthquake. However, a recent study about the earthquake's effect has shown that, although the earthquake might have added further threats to the global economy, its negative impact can be controlled by applying the right measures. 



While the area of EPAM comprises a broad range of phenomena, this workshop will focus mainly on the aspects related to modality understood in a general sense (modalities, hedging, certainty, factuality), negation, attitude, and irony/sarcasm. Since many of these phenomena cannot be adequately modeled without taking (discourse) context into account, the workshop also touches on discourse phenomena in so far as they relate to extra-propositional aspects of meaning.



The workshop is a follow-up to Negation and Speculation in Natural Language Processing (NeSp-NLP 2010) held in Uppsala, Sweden, in July 2010.

Interest Group on Natural Language Learning). Previous CoNLL meetings



were held in Madrid (1997), Sydney (1998), Bergen (1999), Lisbon



(2000), Toulouse (2001), Taipei (2002), Edmonton (2003), Boston



(2004), Ann Arbor (2005), New York (2006) and Prague (2007). This



year, 2008, CoNLL will be collocated with COLING in Manchester, UK.



 



See http://ifarm.nl/signll/ and http://ifarm.nl/signll/conll/



for more information about SIGNLL and CoNLL. The official Web site



of CoNLL-2008 can be found at http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/conll2008/



 



CoNLL is an international conference for research on natural language



learning. We invite submission of papers about natural language



learning topics, including, but not limited to:



 



 * Computational models of human language acquisition



 * Computational models of the evolution of language 



 * Machine learning methods applied to natural language



   processing tasks (speech processing, phonology, morphology,



   syntax, semantics, discourse processing, language



   engineering applications)



 * Statistical methods (Bayesian learning, graphical models,



   kernel methods, statistical models for structured problems)



 * Symbolic learning methods (rule induction and decision



   tree learning, lazy learning, inductive logic programming,



   analytical learning, transformation-based error-driven learning)



 * Biologically-inspired methods (Neural Networks, Evolutionary Computing)



 * Reinforcement learning



 * Active learning, ensemble methods, meta-learning



 * Learning architectures for structural and relational NLP tasks



 * Computational learning theory analysis of language learning



 * Empirical and theoretical comparisons of language learning methods



 * Models of induction and analogy in linguistics



 



Special Topic of Interest



-------------------------



 



This year we wish to encourage the submission of papers on models that



explain natural phenomena relating to human language. This has two



strands.



 



The first concerns the central scientific problem addressed by CoNLL:



the study of first language acquisition. The only systems that we know



of that can process language accurately are humans; the acquisition of



their first language by infant children is one of the central problems



of cognitive science. We invite papers that address this problem using



computational models; including papers that address purely linguistic



aspects of the problem, papers that model psycholinguistic data, or



papers that apply learning theoretic analysis to language acquisition.



 



The second theme is the central engineering problem: how to build



systems that do something useful: we are interested in complete



systems that solve real problems.  Thus we particularly invite papers



that are evaluated on naturally occurring annotations, such as machine



translation, language modelling, or question answering.  We are also



interested in work that evaluates the contribution of components which



predict linguist-defined intermediate structure such as part-of-speech



tags, semantic roles, or syntactic analyses to the performance of real



systems.  Important issues such work might study are the correlation



of the component's performance on the sub-task with its impact on the



end system performance and alternative architectures for incorporating



predictions from different components.



 



Shared Task:



------------



 



The shared task for this CoNLL is ""Joint Parsing of Syntactic and



Semantic Dependencies"".



 



The task proposes the merging of both syntactic dependencies



(extracted from the Penn Treebank ) and semantic dependencies



(extracted both from PropBank and NomBank) under a unique unified



representation. The task has several novel objectives:



 



1. The first objective, performing Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) on



   a dependency-based representation, is to our knowledge novel.



   Furthermore, the SRL problem will address not only propositions



   centered around verbal predicates but also around nouns.



2. The syntactic dependencies to be modeled will be more complex



   than the ones used in the previous CoNLL evaluations: Johansson



   and Nugues have shown that a richer set of syntactic dependencies



   improves semantic processing (Johansson & Nugues 2007).



3. The proposed evaluation offers a practical framework to perform



   joint learning for the two problems.

Submission Guidelines



English submissions should follow the LNCS formatting instructions, without exceeding twelve (12) pages; The submissions must therefore be formatted in accordance with the standard Springer style sheets ([LaTeX][Microsoft Word]) and should be no more than 12 pages in length. Submissions in Chinese should follow the formatting instructions of the ACTA Scientiarum Naturalium Universitatis Pekinensis [Format Template], without exceeding eight (8) pages in A4 (210 × 297 mm) size.

Manuscripts should be submitted electronically through the submission website. Email submissions will not be accepted. Authors of Chinese submissions are required to provide Chinese titles in the submission system. All student first authors are encouraged to contact nlpcc@pku.edu.cn, indicating their names, affiliations, and the titles of their submissions.

All submissions should be in PDF format.



Double-Blind Reviewing

Anonymity Requirements for Double-Blind Reviewing:

Every research paper submitted to NLPCC 2017 will undergo a ""double-blind"" reviewing process: the PC members and referees who review the paper will not know the identity of the authors. To ensure anonymity of authorship, authors must prepare their manuscript as follows:

1. Authors' names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.

2. Funding sources must not be acknowledged on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.

3. Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper.

4. The paper's file name must not identify the authors of the paper. It is strongly suggested that the submitted file be named with the assigned submission number.

5. You must also use care when referring to related previous work, particularly your own work, in the paper. For example, if you are Jane Smith, the following text gives away the authorship of the submitted paper:

In our previous work [1,2], we presented two algorithms for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ...

Bibliography

[1] Jane Smith, ""A Simple Algorithm for ...,"" Proceedings of ACL 2007, pp. 1-8.

[2] Jane Smith, ""A More Complicated Algorithm for ...,"" Proceedings of ACL 2008, pp.33-40.

The solution is to reference your past work in the third person (just as you would any other piece of work that is related to the submitted paper). This allows you to set the context for the submitted paper, while at the same time preserving anonymity:

In previous work [1,2], algorithms were presented for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ...

Bibliography

[1] Jane Smith, ""A Simple Algorithm for ...,"" Proceedings of ACL 2007, pp. 1-8.

[2] Jane Smith, ""A More Complicated Algorithm for ...,"" Proceedings of ACL 2008, pp.33-40.

It is the responsibility of authors to do their very best to preserve anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to rejection without review.

Submission details are provided on the conference website: http://tcci.ccf.org.cn/conference/2017.

For more information about paper submission, contact Xuanjing HUANG, program co-chair (xjhuang@fudan.edu.cn).

Events

In addition to technical contributions, NLPCC 2017 invites proposals for workshops, panels, technical evaluations and industry presentations. For workshops, NLPCC 2017 will provide administrative support for workshop room booking, registration and publication. All papers accepted by NLPCC 2017 workshops will be published in a combined volume of the NLPCC 2017 Proceedings.

Proposals or industry papers should be sent as e-mail attachments to zhaody@pku.edu.cn before Oct. 10, 2017.



Important dates

◇	Paper Submission Deadline: June 5 (Chinese Track) / July 2 (Main Track) (23:59, Beijing time)

◇	Notification: August 20, 2017

◇	Camera ready: September 5, 2017

◇	Tutorials / CCF Advanced Disciplines Lectures (ADL): November 8-10, 2017

◇	Main Conference: November 11-12, 2017



Chinese papers should be submitted to the Chinese Track, and English papers should be submitted to the Main Track. It is also important to note that, since extra time is required to review Chinese papers by the ACTA Scientiarum Naturalium Universitatis Pekinensis, the paper submission deadline of the Chinese Track is about one month earlier than that of the Main Track.

Awards and Grants

German Society for Computational Linguistics and Language Technology

    (GSCL-2015)

30th September - 2nd October 2015

University of Duisburg-Essen, Campus Essen, Germany



Summary

--------------------------------------

The bi-annual meeting of the German Society for Computational

Linguistics and Language Technology (GSCL) in 2015 will take place from

September 30 to October 2 at the University of Duisburg-Essen.



The main conference theme is ""Deep vs. shallow?"".



Currently, computational linguistics as a field seems to split in two

camps: Those interested in 'deep', explanatory, potentially even

cognitively motivated models and those interested in harnessing the

power of emerging big data collections to solve practical problems

efficiently. While the first camp often fights with a lack of coverage

of the intended phenomena, the second camp is occasionally criticized

as naively counting the contents of bags of words.

Of course, the conference theme is designed to provoke contradiction:

Isn't the goal ultimately a synthesis of both approaches that allows

linguistic theory to use 'big data' efficiently and allows broad

coverage technologies to be theoretically well-founded? The conference

aims to discuss the divergence of 'deep' and 'shallow' analysis, but

especially also how to achieve to a synthesis constructively.



Contributions to any topic related to Computational Linguistics and

Language Technology are invited, but we especially encourage

submissions that are related to the main theme, i.e., connecting broad

coverage technologies with linguistic and cognitive theory, e.g.

- learning deep grammars from corpora,

- hybrid machine translation systems,

- making use of 'big data' collections, e.g. for

  - distributional semantics, or

  - analysis of non-standard orthography texts or learner corpora



GSCL Prize

--------------------------------------

The GSCL awards a prize for the best student thesis (Bachelor, Master,

Diploma, Magister) in the field of language technology and

computational linguistics. Theses from the last two years are eligible

and nominations must be made by a supervisor from an academic

institution within the German-speaking area.

Deadline for nominations: 15th May 2015

in the main track. Short papers (typically: ongoing research, project

or system description, opinion piece) will be presented in a special

track with short lighting talks or posters.

Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee

members. Final versions should take into account the comments from the

reviewers.



As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not include the authors'

names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the

author's identity, e.g. ""We previously showed (Smith, 2011) ..."" must

be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ""Smith previously showed

(Smith,

2011) ..."". Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be

      rejected without review. In addition, please do not post your

      submissions on the web until after the review process is

      complete. For a paper to be included in the conference

      proceedings, at least one of the authors must be registered as a

      participant at the GSCL-2015 conference.



Papers will be submitted using the START system, which will be

accessible from the conference web page. Double submission of papers

will need to be notified at submission. Formatting instructions will be

made available on the conference web page.

The 1st International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Informal Text  (NLPIT 2015)

In conjunction with The International Conference on Web Engineering(ICWE 2015)

June 23, 2015, Rotterdam, The Netherlands

http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~badiehm/nlpit2015/

###############################################################################################

Overview

###########

The rapid growth of Internet usage in the last two decades adds new challenges to understand the informal user generated content (UGC) on the Internet. Textual UGC refers to textual posts on social media, blogs, emails, chat conversations, instant messages, forums, reviews, or advertisements that are created by end-users of an online system. A large portion of language used on textual UGC is informal. Informal text is the style of writing that disregard language grammars and uses a mixture of abbreviations and context dependent terms. The straightforward application of state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing approaches on informal text typically results in significantly degraded performance due to the following reasons: the lack of sentence structure; the lack of enough context required; the seldom entities involved; the noisy sparse contents of users' contributions; and the untrusted facts contained. It is the aim of this work- shop to bring the attention of researchers to the opportunities and challenges involved in informal text processing. In particular, we are interested in discussing informal text modeling, normalization, mining, and understanding in addition to various application areas in which UGC is involved.



Topics

###########

We invite submissions on topics that include, but are not limited to, the following core NLP approaches for informal UGC: language identification, classification, clustering, filtering, summarization, tokenization, segmentation, morphological analysis, POS tagging, parsing, named entity extraction, named entity disambiguation, relation/fact extraction, semantic annotation, sentiment analysis, language normalization, informality modeling and measuring, language generation, handling uncertainties, machine translation, ontology construction, dictionary construction, etc.



Submission

###########

Authors are invited to submit original work not submitted to another conference or workshop. Workshop submissions could be a full paper or short paper. Paper length should not exceed 12 pages for full papers and 6 pages for short papers. All papers should follow the Springer's LNCS format. Papers in PDF can be sent via the EasyChair Conference System https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nlpit2015. Each submission will receive, in addition to a meta-review, at least 2 peer double-blind reviews. Each full paper will get 25 minutes presentation time. Short papers will get 5 minutes presentation time in addition to a poster. Beside papers, we also plan to have an invited talk by a renowned scientist on a topic relevant for the workshop. Workshop proceedings will be published as part of the ICWE2015 workshop proceedings. To contact the NLPIT 2015 organization team, please send an e-mail to: nlpit2015@easychair.org.

Keynote Speech

###############

-Speaker: Nathan Schneider



-Title: Hacking a Way Through the Twitter Language Jungle: Syntactic Annotation, Tagging, and Parsing of English Tweets. 



-Abstract: Diverse genres of digital text are forcing us to rethink our modus operandi in NLP: with a Web awash in natural language text from ordinary users, it is not enough to be able to analyze well-edited news sentences. To build tools that are accurate for other linguistic styles, we need new linguistic resources. Unfortunately, traditional forms of syntactic analysis are expensive and do not readily adapt to informal genres. This talk plunges into parsing in the Twitter jungle, following a trajectory that tightly integrates linguistic data preparation and statistical modeling. I argue against treating traditional linguistic representations as sacrosanct, and instead present new representations that are simpler and more flexible for conversational text. Taking advantage of these for a streamlined annotation process, I and colleagues at CMU have compiled datasets of tweets and built domain-appropriate POS taggers and parsers (Gimpel et al., ACL 2011; Owoputi et al., NAACL 2013; Schneider et al., LAW 2013; Kong et al., EMNLP 2014). Would-be Twitter trailblazers are invited to plunder these resources, which are stashed at http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/TweetNLP/.



-Bio: Nathan Schneider is an annotation schemer and computational modeler for natural language. His 2014 dissertation (Carnegie Mellon University) introduced a coarse-grained representation for lexical semantics that facilitates rapid annotation and is practical for broad-coverage statistical NLP. He has also worked on semantic parsing for the FrameNet representation, the design of the Abstract Meaning Representation formalism, and other forms of syntactic/semantic annotation and processing for social media text. He is presently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Edinburgh, where he continues to play with data and algorithms for linguistic meaning.

Most of this information is available as text. News portals disseminate political stories at unprecedented rates, politicians and political elites advertise their own messages through social media outlets and crowdsourcing provides new affordable and quick venues for asking citizens what they think about politics. With political texts at our fingertips, vexing research questions are emerging.



Extracting, organizing, and analyzing large amounts of textual information can be quite resource-intensive with many political scientists lacking the skills necessary for dealing with such data. Fortunately, recent developments of cutting edge computational technologies such as natural language-processing, machine learning, and information extraction techniques has made research utilizing text-as-data more accessible and appealing.



On the other hand, computational scholars equipped with novel technologies and linguistic solutions often have less experience with social science theories and less contextual knowledge about political data. There is a mutual benefit in connecting disparate worlds of computational text analysis and political science in analyzing political research problems. The aim of this conference is to facilitate this multidisciplinary cooperation.



We are interested in contributions on computational approaches in analysing political text such as government speeches, political debates, social media, media content, party manifestos and/or legislation.



This conference is looking for, but not limited to, contributions from the following topics with a focus on politically relevant data:

• text categorization

• topic modeling

• information extraction

• corpus analysis

• sentiment analysis

• stance classification and ideal point estimation 

• argumentation mining

• political reputation analysis

• techniques for multilingual text analysis

• other language technologies



INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS



Authors are invited to submit abstracts (up to 500 words) in the topic areas of the conference. Abstracts should be submitted electronically via the EasyChair conference submission website.



After acceptance, authors should prepare short papers (may consist of up to five (5) double column pages of content, with two (2) additional pages for references). All accepted abstracts will be published in the format of short papers in the conference proceedings and disseminated electronically before the conference.

COMPUTATIONAL METHODS FOR MEASURING LANGUAGE COMPLEXITY

WORKSHOP HELD IN CONJUNCTION WITH 



IJCAI-2017  

INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

http://ijcai-17.org/



MELBOURNE, AUGUST 19-25, 2017





PAPER SUBMISSION DEADLINE: May 15, 2017





SCOPE



This workshop focuses on natural language complexity. Complexity has become an important concept in several scientific disciplines. There has been a lot of research on complexity and complex systems in the natural sciences, economics, social sciences and, now, also increasingly in linguistics. Are all languages equally complex? Does it make sense to compare the complexity of languages? Can languages differ in complexity?  Complexity is a controversial concept in linguistics. Until recently, natural language complexity has not been widely researched and still not clear how complexity has to be defined and measured. Twentieth century most theoretical linguists have defended the equi-complexity dogma, which states that the total complexity of a natural language is fixed because sub-complexities in linguistic sub-systems trade off. This idea of equi-complexity, seen for decades as an unquestioned truism of linguistics, has begun to be explicitly questioned in recent years. There have been attempts to apply the concept of complexity used in other disciplines in order to find useful tools to calculate linguistic complexity. Information theory, computational models or the theory of complex systems are examples of areas that provide measures to quantitatively evaluate linguistic complexity.



Many models have been proposed to confirm or refute the hypothesis of linguistic equi-complexity. The tools, criteria and measures to quantify the level of complexity of languages vary and depend on the specific research interests and on the definition of complexity adopted. In fact, there is no agreement in the literature about how to define complexity. Instead, in the literature, we can find a variety of approaches that has led to linguistic complexity taxonomy: absolute complexity vs. relative complexity; global complexity vs. local complexity; system complexity vs. structural complexity, etc. Currently, there is no clear solution to quantify the complexity of languages and each of the proposed models has advantages and disadvantages. 



Linguistic complexity is also a key point in automatic natural language processing. Therefore, we propose a cross-discipline workshop that foster exchange of ideas between people in the area of artificial intelligence and natural language processing and people dealing with natural language complexity from a cognitive or a theoretical point of view. The main objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers from different areas that have in common their interest on linguistic complexity boosting the interchange of knowledge and methods between specialists that have approached complexity from different viewpoints.  We want to promote interdisciplinarity among researchers that are dealing with any type of language complexity. 



Therefore, we are interested in contributions introducing new methods, models, definitions and measures to assess natural languages complexity. We are especially interested in computational and formal approaches to linguistic complexity.

The MUMTTT workshop will be held on the last day of the Europhras’2019 conference, namely on  27th  September 2019. It will provide a forum for researchers and practitioners in the  fields of (Computational) Linguistics, (Computational) Phraseology, Translation Studies and Translation Technology to discuss recent advances in the area of multi-word unit processing and to coordinate research efforts across disciplines in order to improve the integration of multi-word units in machine translation and translation technology tools.

Multi-word units are word combinations which range from compounds such as ‘credit card’ to idiomatic expressions such as “’it is raining cats and dogs’ and are acknowledged as one of the major challenges in natural language processing (NLP), because of their lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and/or statistical idiosyncracies.

In spite of the relative progress achieved in translation technology with the adoption of neural approaches and in the processing for particular types of units such as verb-particle constructions, the identification, interpretation and translation of multi-word units in general still represent open challenges, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view. The idiosyncratic morpho-syntactic, semantic and translational properties of multi-word units pose many obstacles even to human translators, mainly because of intrinsic ambiguities, structural and lexical asymmetries between languages, and, finally, cultural differences.

In recent years, growing attention has been paid to integrating multi-word units (MWUs) in machine translation and translation technology tools, as it has been acknowledged that it is not possible to create large scale language solutions without properly handling MWUs of all types. As a matter of fact, researchers are now addressing the problems posed by MWU processing and translation using different formalisms and techniques, such as automatic recognition of MWUs in a monolingual or bilingual setting; alignment and paraphrasing techniques; development and use of (handcrafted) monolingual and bilingual language resources; creation of annotated monolingual and parallel corpora, development of strategies for handling syntactically flexible units in language analysis and translation modules, development of evaluation projects. The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners working on MWU processing from various perspectives, in order to enable cross-fertilisation and foster the creation of innovative solutions that can only arise from interdisciplinary collaborations. In particular, the workshop welcomes interactions between NLP researchers working on the computational treatment of multi-word units, experts in (computational) phraseology working on challenging topics of their discipline, as well as translation practitioners, to the benefit of applying their latest results to advance the state of the art in MWU processing.

Topics of Interest

The MUMTTT 2019 workshop invites the submission of papers reporting on original and unpublished research on topics related to MWU processing in machine translation and translation technology, including:

- Lexical, syntactic, semantic and translational aspects in MWU representation

- Theoretical approaches to MWUs (e.g., collostructional analysis of MWU, cognitive approaches to processing MWUs, etc.)

- Development of multilingual MWU resources

-Identification and acquisition of MWUs and variants

-Learning semantic information about MWUs from monolingual, parallel or comparable corpora

-Development and use of MWU resources in machine translation and translation technology

-Development of corpora for the extraction and translation of MWUs

-Compilation of resources for the extraction and translation of multiword units

-Creation of MWU-annotated corpora with a focus on translation aspects

-Paraphrasing of MWUs applied to the improvement of machine translation

-MWUs and word alignment techniques

-MWUs in machine translation

CAFFEi-2008



Workshop on Computational aspects of affectual and emotional interaction

21-22 July 2008, Patras, Greece

http://caffei.iit.demokritos.gr/



The workshop is organized as part of the 18th European Conference on

Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2008) and will be held in July 2008,

in Patras, Greece.



NEW DEADLINE: 18 April 2008



Please note that papers may be submitted to ECAI (main conference) as

well as CAFFEi with the right to retract your submission if accepted

at ECAI.





Description and Topics

======================



A key enabling technology for next-generation artificial intelligence

agents for the service, domestic and entertainment market is natural

human-computer interaction. An AI agent that collaborates with humans

on a daily basis requires interactive skills that go beyond

present-day language technology: seamless and natural interaction

requires that the AI agent is able to correctly interpret (and to some

some extend also generate) linguistic signals that involve the

emotional state of the person they interact with, to behave

differently in different emotional contexts, to exhibit a different

personality in order to co-operate well with humans having different

personalities, and to correctly interpret humour or irony.



CAFFEi aims to bring together researchers working on the computational

modelling of emotions and affect, and especially their linguistic

realization, for the purposes of affectual human-computer interaction.



Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:



 * affect and emotion recognition and generation, and particularly

   linguistic aspects thereof in text and speech;

 * personality trait modelling, and impact of computer personality

   traits and affect analysis on natural language generation and

   dialogue management;

 * evaluation of emotional impact of automatically generated text;

 * evaluation methods for emotion-sensitive parsing, generation, and

   dialogue management;

 * emotion text classification and affect text classification,

   used to evaluate or analyse human-computer or human-human

   interaction;

 * generating and recognizing humour and irony;

 * non-linguistic aspects of human-computer interaction, such as

   facial, gesture, and posture recognition, audio signal processing,

   avatars and virtual faces, etc., especially when used in

   conjunction to linguistic interaction modalities.

Linguistics for Uralic Languages is to bring together researchers working

on computational approaches to working with these languages. We accept

papers and tutorial proposals working on the following languages: Finnish,

Hungarian, Estonian, Voru, Setu, the Sámi languages, Komi (Zyrian,

Permyak), Mordvin (Erzya, Moksha), Mari (Hill, Meadow), Udmurt, Nenets

(Tundra, Forest), Enets (Tundra, Forest), Nganasan, Selkup, Mansi, Khanty,

Veps, Karelian, Ingrian (Izhorian), Votic, Livonian, Ludic, Kven and other

related languages.



All Uralic languages exhibit rich morphological structure, which makes

processing them challenging for state-of-the-art computational linguistic

approaches, the majority also suffer from a lack of resources and many are

endangered.



Research papers should be original, substantial and unpublished research,

that can describe work-in-progress systems, frameworks, standards and

evaluation schemes. Demos and tutorials will present systems and standards

towards the goal of interoperability and unification of different projects,

applications and research groups . Appropriate topics include (but are not

limited to):



Parsers, analysers and processing pipelines of Uralic languages

Lexical databases, electronic dictionaries

Finished end-user applications aimed at Uralic languages, such as spelling

or grammar checkers, machine translation or speech processing

Evaluation methods and gold standards, tagged corpora, treebanks

Reports on language-independent or unsupervised methods as applied to

Uralic languages

Surveys and review articles on subjects related to computational

linguistics for one or more Uralic languages

Any work that aims at combining efforts and reducing duplication of work

How to elicit activity from the language community, agitation campaigns,

games with a purpose



To maximise the possibility of reproducibility, replication and reuse, we

particularly encourage submissions which present free/open-source language

resources and make use of free/open-source software.



One of the aims of this gathering is to avoid unnecessary duplicated work

in field of Uralistics by establishing connections and interoperability

standards between researchers and research groups working at different

sites. We have also identified a serious lack of gold standards and

evaluation metrics for all Uralic languages including those with national

support, any work towards better resources in these fields will be greatly

appreciated."

SemEval-2017 Task 7:

Detection and Interpretation of English Puns



http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task7/



Researchers and industry professionals are invited to participate in a

shared task on the computational detection and interpretation of English

puns. The task will occur as part of the SemEval-2017 workshop, to be

collocated with the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for

Computational Linguistics in Vancouver, Canada on August 3-4, 2017.

SemEval is an ongoing series of evaluations of computational

semantic analysis systems, organized under the aegis of SIGLEX, the

Special Interest Group on the Lexicon of the Association for

Computational Linguistics.





---- Task description ----



A pun is a form of wordplay in which one signifier (e.g., a word or

phrase) suggests two or more meanings by exploiting polysemy, or

phonological similarity to another signifier, for an intended humorous

or rhetorical effect.  Puns where the two meanings share the same

spelling are known as homographic, whereas those where the two meanings

are spelled (and also usually pronounced) differently are known as

heterographic.



Conscious or tacit linguistic knowledge -- particularly of lexical

semantics and phonology -- is an essential prerequisite for the

production and interpretation of puns. This has long made them an

attractive subject of study in theoretical linguistics, and has led to a

small but growing body of research into puns in computational

linguistics.  This SemEval shared task will be the first organized

evaluation of automatic pun processing systems.



Participants will be provided with two data sets.  The first data set

will contain several hundred short contexts (jokes, slogans, aphorisms,

etc.). In some of these contexts, a single word will be used as a

homographic pun; in the rest, there will be no pun.  The second data set

will be similar to the first, except that the puns will be heterographic

rather than homographic.  For one or both data sets, participating

systems will compete in any or all of three subtasks:



Subtask 1: Pun detection. For this subtask, participants are given an

entire raw data set. For each context, the system must decide whether or

not it contains a pun.



Subtask 2: Pun location. For this subtask, the contexts not containing

puns are removed from the data set. For each context, the system must

identify which word is the pun.



Subtask 3: Pun interpretation.  For this subtask, the pun word in each

context is marked, and contexts where the pun's two meanings are not

found in WordNet are removed from the data set. For each context, the

system must annotate the two meanings of the given pun by reference to

WordNet sense keys.



System performance will be measured with the usual metrics from

information retrieval and WSD.  Please see the task website for further

details.

Workshop on Multimodal Analyses enabling Artificial Agents in Human-Machine Interaction - Call for Papers



Workshop Website: http://fastnet.netsoc.ie/ma3_2012/Welcome.html



The workshop will be held on September, 15th at the 12th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents, University of California, Santa Cruz (IVA 2012) 

Conference website: http://iva2012.soe.ucsc.edu/





**********SUBMISSION DEADLINE EXTENDED: July 16th 2012 (23:59 UTC/GMT -11) **************





CALL FOR PAPERS



Exploring how human beings interact with the world and with each other is of outstanding importance for creating what is commonly named intelligent behaviour in Human-Machine Interaction. In the scientific community there is a growing interest in new techniques aimed at obtaining a more natural and human like interaction with machines. It is important, in the framework of intelligent virtual agent, to find the space for a socially intelligent virtual agent.

An appropriate system whether it is a virtual agent or a companion-like device has to analyse multiple sources of information to interact with humans in a proper and socially aware way. Such modalities are in general speech and its content, mimicry, gesture, biological signals, etc., and in particular it is the prosodic and paralinguistic features of the speech, facial mimicry, and heart rate, etc.

The aim of this workshop is to discuss techniques for gathering and analysing information on multimodal signals, combining methods of analysis in order to understand the correlation between different sources of information (gesture, speech, motion, etc.), as well as understanding how the environment and the context can influence how participants react.

Agents and smart devices are already more than a pure system. They become companions and a kind of friend. Thus, a Human- Machine Interaction will be no longer fixed on a task solution; it will be more human like, and include elements of chat and non- fixed gestures. The workshop will discuss the combination of these different signals, to foster more human-like interactions with virtual agents.



Workshop topics include, but are not limited to:





    Multimodal recognition and identification of user behaviour



    Awareness of the user's/agent's situation based on multimodal data



    Analysis of Human-Machine conversations



    Comparison of Human-Human vs. Human-Machine conversations



    Strategies of multimodal Human-Machine Interaction



    Analyses of speech and prosody wrt. paralinguistic features



    Mimicry and gesture analyses



    Using multimodal data sets for Human-Machine Interaction



    Annotation and processing of multimodal data sets



    Developments and combinations of analysis methods



    Applications of agents in Human-Machine Interaction

Website: https://circse.github.io/LT4HALA/

Date: May 12, 2020

Place: co-located with LREC 2020 (https://lrec2020.lrec-conf.org/en/), May 11-16, Marseille, France



Description



LT4HALA is a one-day workshop that seeks to bring together scholars who are developing and/or are using Language Technologies (LTs) for historically attested languages, so to foster cross-fertilization between the Computational Linguistics community and the areas in the Humanities dealing with historical linguistic data, e.g. historians, philologists, linguists, archaeologists and literary scholars. Despite the current availability of large collections of digitized texts written in historical languages, such interdisciplinary collaboration is still hampered by the limited availability of annotated linguistic resources for most of the historical languages. Creating such resources is a challenge and an obligation for LTs, both to support historical linguistic research with the most updated technologies and to preserve those precious linguistic data that survived from past times.



Relevant topics for the workshop include, but are not limited to:



+ handling spelling variation;

+ detection and correction of OCR errors;

+ creation and annotation of digital resources;

+ deciphering;

+ morphological/syntactic/semantic analysis of textual data;

+ adaptation of tools to address diachronic/diatopic/diastratic variation in texts;

+ teaching ancient languages with NLP tools;

+ NLP-driven theoretical studies in historical linguistics;

+ evaluation of NLP tools.



Shared Tasks



Just because of the limited amount of data preserved for historical and ancient languages, an important role is played by evaluation practices, to understand the level of accuracy of the NLP tools used to build and analyze resources. Given the prominence of Latin, by virtue of its wide diachronic and diatopic span covering two millennia all over Europe, the workshop will host the first edition of EvaLatin, an evaluation campaign entirely devoted to the evaluation of NLP tools for Latin. The first edition of EvaLatin will focus on two tasks (i.e. Lemmatization and PoS tagging), each featuring three sub-tasks (i.e. Classical, Cross-Genre, Cross-Time). These sub-tasks are designed to measure the impact of genre and diachrony on NLP tools performances, a relevant aspect to keep in mind when dealing with the diachronic and diatopic diversity of Latin. Participants will be provided with shared data in the CoNLL-U format and the evaluation script.



Submissions



For the workshop, we invite papers of different types such as experimental papers, reproduction papers, resource papers, position papers, survey papers. Both long and short papers describing original and unpublished work are welcome. Long papers should deal with substantial completed research and/or report on the development of new methodologies. They may consist of up to 8 pages of content plus 2 pages of references. Short papers are instead appropriate for reporting on works in progress or for describing a singular tool or project. They may consist of up to 4 pages of content plus 2 pages of references. We encourage the authors of papers reporting experimental results to make their results reproducible and the entire process of analysis replicable, by making the data and the tools they used available. The form of the presentation may be oral or poster, whereas in the proceedings there is no difference between the accepted papers. The submission is NOT anonymous. The LREC official format is requested. Each paper will be reviewed but three independent reviewers.



As for EvaLatin, participants will be required to submit a technical report for each task (with all the related sub-tasks) they took part in. Technical reports will be included in the proceedings as short papers: the maximum length is 4 pages (excluding references) and they should follow the LREC official format. Reports will receive a light review (we will check for the correctness of the format, the exactness of results and ranking, and overall exposition). All participants will have the possibility to present their results at the workshop: we will allocate an oral session and a poster session fully devoted to the shared tasks.

Share your LRs!



Describing your LRs in the LRE Map is now a normal practice in the submission procedure of LREC (introduced in 2010 and adopted by other conferences). To continue the efforts initiated at LREC 2014 about “Sharing LRs” (data, tools, web-services, etc.), authors will have the possibility, when submitting a paper, to upload LRs in a special LREC repository. This effort of sharing LRs, linked to the LRE Map for their description, may become a new “regular” feature for conferences in our field, thus contributing to creating a common repository where everyone can deposit and share data.



ISLRN number



As scientific work requires accurate citations of referenced work so as to allow the community to understand the whole context and also replicate the experiments conducted by other researchers, LREC 2020 endorses the need to uniquely Identify LRs through the use of the International Standard Language Resource Number (ISLRN), a Persistent Unique Identifier to be assigned to each Language Resource. The assignment of ISLRNs to LRs cited in LREC papers will be offered at submission time.

The 2nd International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Informal Text  (NLPIT 2016)

In conjunction with The World Wide Web Conference (WWW 2016)

April 11-15, 2016, Montreal, Canada

http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~badiehm/nlpit2016/

###############################################################################################

Overview

###########

The rapid growth of Internet usage in the last two decades adds new challenges to understand the informal user generated content (UGC) on the Internet. Textual UGC refers to textual posts on social media, blogs, emails, chat conversations, instant messages, forums, reviews, or advertisements that are created by end-users of an online system. A large portion of language used on textual UGC is informal. Informal text is the style of writing that disregards language grammars and uses a mixture of abbreviations and context dependent terms. The straightforward application of state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing approaches on informal text typically results in significantly degraded performance due to the following reasons: the lack of sentence structure; the lack of enough context required; the seldom entities involved; the noisy sparse contents of users' contributions; and the untrusted facts contained. It is the aim of this work- shop to bring the attention of researchers to the opportunities and challenges involved in informal text processing. In particular, we are interested in discussing informal text modeling, normalization, mining, and understanding in addition to various application areas in which UGC is involved.



Topics

###########

We invite submissions on topics that include, but are not limited to, the following core NLP approaches for informal UGC: language identification, classification, clustering, filtering, summarization, tokenization, segmentation, morphological analysis, POS tagging, parsing, named entity extraction, named entity disambiguation, relation/fact extraction, semantic annotation, sentiment analysis, language normalization, informality modeling and measuring, language generation, handling uncertainties, machine translation, ontology construction, dictionary construction, etc.



Submission

###########

Authors are invited to submit original work not submitted to another conference or workshop. Workshop submissions could be a full paper or short paper. Paper length should not exceed 10 pages for full papers and 5 pages for short papers. All papers should be formatted according to the ACM SIG Proceedings template (http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates). Papers in PDF can be sent via the EasyChair Conference System (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nlpit2016). Each submission will receive, in addition to a meta-review, at least 2 peer double-blind reviews. Therefore, the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity must be avoided. Each full paper will get 25 minutes presentation time. Short papers will get 5 minutes presentation time in addition to a poster. Beside papers, we also plan to have an invited talk by a renowned scientist on a topic relevant for the workshop. Workshop proceedings will be published as part of the WWW2016 workshop proceedings. To contact the NLPIT 2016 organization team, please send an e-mail to: nlpit2016@easychair.org.

Affect analysis of content to measure emotions and its experiences is

 a multidisciplinary research area with limited cross-disciplinary collaboration. Other disciplines have adopted psychological models of affect - Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computational Linguistics (CL) and Human-computer Interaction (HCI) - to conceptualize

 and measure users’ opinions, intentions, and expressions. However, the context-specific characteristics of human affect suggest the need to measure in ways that recognize multiple interpretations of human responses.

The 13th Workshop on Multiword Expressions (MWE 2017)

Final Call for Papers

4 April 2017, colocated with EACL 2017 - http://multiword.sf.net/mwe2017

Endorsed by ACL SIGLEX - the Special Interest Group on the Lexicon of the ACL

Long and short paper submission deadline (extended): Jan 22, 2016

mwe2017workshop@gmail.com



In natural languages, there are many ways to express complex human thoughts and ideas. This can be achieved by exploiting compositionality, i.e. concatenating simplex elements of language and thus yielding a more complex meaning that can be computed from the meaning of the original parts and the way they are combined. However, non-compositional phrases are also very frequent in any human language. These complex phrases can often be decomposed into single meaningful units, but the meaning of the whole phrase cannot (or can only partially) be computed from the meaning of its parts. Such phrases are often called multiword expressions (MWEs) and display lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and/or statistical idiosyncrasies (Baldwin & Kim 2010). In addition to idiomatic constructions, MWEs encompass closely related linguistic constructs such as light verb constructions, rhetorical figures and institutionalized phrases or collocations (Sag et al. 2002). MWEs pose problems for linguistic processing, especially in language learning and natural language processing (NLP), for instance, in machine translation, syntactic and semantic parsing, just to name a few applications. 



Researchers from several disciplines such as computer science, linguistics and psychology have been jointly working on MWE modeling and processing. For instance, designing guidelines for the annotation of MWEs in corpora, and prominently in treebanks, has been undertaken in various languages and linguistic frameworks (Rosén et al. 2015). Lexical resources with MWEs in dozens of languages exist and are still being developed (Losnegaard et al. 2016). Many papers describe methods to discover new MWEs in texts, applying a wide variety of tools and techniques such as association measures, distributional methods and machine learning. Interactions of MWE processing with deeper levels of linguistic analysis, notably parsing and semantic processing, are being increasingly investigated (e.g. in SEMEVAL 2016 task 10 - DiMSUM). Special issues on MWEs have been published by leading journals (CSL in 2005, LR&E in 2010, ACM TSLP in 2013). Several funded projects focusing on MWEs are indicative of the growing importance of the field within the NLP community. For instance, the EU H2020 program currently supports the COST Action PARSEME (2013-2017), that addresses the role of MWEs in parsing and gathers more than 200 researchers from 33 countries covering 30 languages. It also inspired several national spin-off projects on MWEs.



Many of these advances are described and published in the annual MWE workshop. It attracts the attention of an ever-growing community working on a variety of languages and linguistic phenomena. The workshop has been held since 2001 in conjunction with major computational linguistics conferences (ACL, COLING, LREC, EACL). It represents an important venue for the community to interact, share resources and tools, and collaborate on efforts for advancing the computational treatment of MWEs. 

We invite papers on major challenges in MWE processing, both from theoretical and computational viewpoints, focusing on research related (but not limited) to the following topics: 



Manually and automatically constructed lexical resources

MWE representation in lexical resources

MWE annotation in corpora and treebanks

MWEs in non-standard language (e.g. tweets, forums, spontaneous speech)

Original MWE discovery methods (e.g. using word embeddings, parallel corpora)

Original MWE in-context identification methods (e.g. using deep learning, topic models)

MWE processing in syntactic frameworks (e.g. HPSG, LFG, TAG, universal dependencies)

MWE processing in semantic frameworks (e.g. WSD, semantic parsing)

MWE processing in end-user applications (e.g. summarization, machine translation)

Orchestration of MWE processing with respect to applications

Evaluation of MWE processing techniques

Models of first and second language acquisition of MWEs

Theoretical and psycholinguistic studies on MWEs

Crosslinguistic studies on MWEs 



A volume with selected papers from the workshop is planned within the book series Phraseology and MultiWord Expressions that is the MWE-dedicated book series of Language Science Press.  



SPECIAL TRACK: Shared task on automatic identification of verbal MWEs



This year, there will be an extension to the traditional workshop: a special track for shared task papers. The shared task will compare and evaluate systems for the automatic identification of verbal MWEs in sentences. Participants will have the opportunity to submit shared task system description papers and present their approach and results at the workshop. For more details, see the separate call for shared task participation: http://multiword.sourceforge.net/sharedtask2017/



INVITED TALK

We are happy to announce that the invited talk of MWE 2017 will be given by Paul Cook (University of New Brunswick).



SUBMISSION MODALITIES 

The main track will feature long and short papers:

Long papers (8 content pages + references): Long papers should report on solid and finished research including new experimental results, resources and/or techniques.

Short papers (4 content pages + references): Short papers should report on small experiments, focused contributions, ongoing research, negative results and/or philosophical discussion.



The shared task track will feature system description papers:

System description papers (4 content pages + references): System description papers briefly describe the approach implemented to solve the problem. They may include references and links to more detailed descriptions in other documents.



There is no limit on the number of reference pages. Authors will be granted an extra page for the final version of their papers.



For the main track, submission will be double-blind, the reported research should be substantially original and the papers will be presented orally or as posters. The decision as to which papers will be presented orally and which as posters will be made by the program committee based on the nature rather than on the quality of the work.

The shared task system description papers will go through a separate reviewing process. Like in SEMEVAL, submissions will be double-blind and will be reviewed by the shared task organizers and participants according to the schedule below. The selected papers will be presented as posters. Participants of the shared task are not required to submit system description papers, and their acceptance depends on the quality of the paper rather than on the results obtained in the shared task.



All papers should use the EACL 2017 LaTeX templates and should be submitted via the START space. Please choose the appropriate submission type, according to the category of your paper. Final versions of accepted papers will be submitted both in PDF and source LaTeX formats.

First Call for Papers



SWAIE 2013: Semantic Web and Information Extraction

http://semanticweb.cs.vu.nl/swaie2013/



Full-day workshop in conjunction with RANLP 2013



Deadline: 3 July 2013, 23:59 Hawaii Time

****************************************************************



INTRODUCTION



There is a vast wealth of information available in textual format that the Semantic Web cannot yet tap into: 80% of data on the Web and on internal corporate intranets is unstructured, hence analysing and structuring the data - social analytics and next generation analytics - is a large and growing endeavour. The goal of the 2nd workshop on Semantic Web and Information Extraction is to bring researchers from the fields of Information Extraction and the Semantic Web together to foster inter-domain collaboration. To make sense of the large amounts of textual data now available, we need help from both the Information Extraction and Semantic Web communities. The Information Extraction community specialises in mining the nuggets of information from text: such techniques could, however, be enhanced by annotated data or domain-specific resources. The Semantic Web community has already taken great strides in making these resources available through the Linked Open Data cloud, which are now ready for uptake by the Information Extraction community. The workshop invites contributions around three particular topics: 1) Semantic Web-driven Information Extraction, 2) Information Extraction for the Semantic Web, and 3) applications and architectures on the intersection of Semantic Web and Information Extraction.





MOTIVATION



The Semantic Web aims to add a machine tractable, repurposable layer to complement the existing web of natural language hypertext. In order to realise this vision, the creation of semantic annotation, the linking of Web pages to ontologies and the creation, evolution and interrelation of ontologies must become automatic or semi-automatic processes. Information Extraction, a form of natural language analysis, is becoming a central technology to link Semantic Web models with documents. On the other hand, traditional Information Extraction can be enhanced by the addition of semantic information, enabling disambiguation of concepts, reasoning and inference to take place over the documents. The primary goal of this workshop is to advance the understanding of the relationship between Information Extraction and Semantic Web. Â With the adoption of the Web 2.0 paradigm, these technologies further face new challenges because of their inherent multi-source nature, while the rapidly increasing use of social media Â also brings a new set of problems in dealing with degraded forms of text such as incorrect grammar, spelling and so on. Information Extraction now has to deal not just with isolated texts or single narratives but with large scale repositories or sources -- in one or many languages -- containing a multiplicity of views, opinions, or commentaries on particular topics, entities or events, in very diverse styles and formats. New methods and tools thus need to be developed to deal with the changing face of data and the changing needs of society. Furthermore, traditional platforms and architectures for Information Extraction are not necessarily capable of smooth handling of the transition to more semantic forms of annotation. While language analysis tools may not require sophisticated ontology handling mechanisms, the ensuing lack of interoperability can be problematic when embedding such tools and platforms in Semantic Web architectures.





INTENDED AUDIENCE



Participants will come from various areas of research that are represented in the Semantic Web and Information Extraction communities such as: artificial intelligence, ontology population, data mining, machine learning, knowledge representation, and web information systems. Some participants will probably be especially interested in particular application areas, such as the biomedical domain, government, cultural heritage, or entertainment.





WORKSHOP TOPICS



We welcome high-quality papers about current trends in the areas listed in the following, non-exhaustive list of topics. We will seek application-oriented, as well as more theoretical papers and position papers. Each submission should explicitly address one or more of the three main topics. In addition to presenting specific results, the paper should discuss the more general implications for the topics and/or subtopics that it addresses. Where feasible, contributions should include a system demonstration that illustrates the key ideas of the work and encourages interactive discussion at the workshop. There will also be an opportunity to present late-breaking work or novel ideas as a 2-minute lightning talk during the afternoon; these topics may be the stimulus for further debate during the open discussion period.

        

1. Semantic Web-driven Information Extraction





                Integrating ontologies/Linked Open Data with Language Resources

                Enriching Information Extraction systems with Semantic Web data/technologies

2. Information Extraction for the Semantic Web





                Extraction from unstructured versus semi-structured textual sources

                Dealing with the imperfections of Information Extraction techniques in the Semantic Web setting and their impact

                Multi-source or multilingual Information Extraction for ontology population

                Information extraction subtasks (e.g., terminology extraction, relation extraction, coreference resolution) for the Semantic Web

                Methods and metrics for evaluation of Information Extraction for the Semantic Web



3. Applications and Architecture





        Ontology-based Information Extraction for specific domains and applications, e.g. business analytics, healthcare and biomedicine, cultural heritage etc.

        Information Extraction for social media mining

Full Day Workshop at IEEE ICHI 2019

http://www.ieee-ichi.org/

Beijing, China, June 10, 2019



Call for Papers:

Neural embedding methods have made a huge splash in NLP, and many researchers are exploring applications for mining biomedical articles and clinical text. The recency and momentum of this field might be enough reason to motivate a workshop on this topic. However, there has also been a burst of creative explorations in the biomedical arena: Augmenting neural embeddings with context, disambiguation and semantics; building in sequential and discourse information; hyperbolic embeddings; and asymmetric relations for sentence entailment, to name a few. There have also been explorations of vector representations of text that are not based on neural embeddings: For example, implicit similarity metrics; high dimensional predication spaces; neurobiological-based vector dimensions; and noncommutative concept relations defined using quantum logic. 

This workshop aims to explore the latest methodological advances in vector representations of words, sentences, and documents, and their applications to downstream tasks. These tasks range from text classification and summarization, to patient phenotyping and cohort discovery, to sentiment analysis and prediction of suicide risk, to literature based discovery. This workshop will also make an effort to stimulate the establishment of shared community resources that will allow different groups to take advantage of others’ code and datasets, and thus make it easier for groups to compare methods on different downstream tasks. 

To increase the diversity of ideas and people represented at the workshop, we will attempt to utilize Skype or a similar web-based platform to allow registered participants, who are unable to travel to Beijing, to make remote presentations and participate in the discussions. (However, due to the vagaries of the internet, we cannot guarantee the quality or connectivity of remote participation.)

We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all aspects of computational linguistics.



About COLING

The first COLING was held in New York in 1965, with the last iteration in Osaka in 2016. Throughout its history COLING has brought together researchers from across the field of Computational Linguistics.



With COLING 2018 we continue this tradition and welcome papers on all topics related to both natural language and contribution, with the expectation that all papers will include linguistic insight.



Towards the goal of attracting and selecting a high quality, diverse program, COLING 2018 invites papers of a broad variety of distinct types, detailed below.



Important Dates

Submission for mentoring: February 16, 2018

Final submissions due: March 16, 2018

Author feedback: April 20-24, 2018

Notifications: May 17, 2018

Main conference: August 22-25, 2018



Submission Instructions

We invite submissions of up to nine (9) pages maximum, plus bibliography. The COLING 2018 templates must be used; these will be provided in LaTeX and also Microsoft Word format. Submissions will only be accepted in PDF format. Deviations from the provided templates should result in rejections without review. Submit papers by the end of the deadline day via our softconf site; the timezone is UTC-12.



Types of Paper

We invite papers in the following categories, each of which is associated with a distinct review form.



COMPUTATIONALLY-AIDED LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS

The focus of this paper type is new linguistic insight. Originality could be in the linguistic question being addressed, in the methodology applied to the linguistic question, or in the combination of the two. It should be shown how results generalize, either by deepening our understanding of some linguistic system in general or by demonstrating methodology that can be applied to other problems.



NLP ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT PAPER

This type of paper tests a hypothesis about the effectiveness of a technique for a task. The hypothesis should be clearly stated, the testing methodology rigorous, and the experiment reproducible. Furthermore, a successful COLING paper of this type will include thoughtful error analysis and a clear explanation of how the results in the experiment relate to the hypothesis.



REPRODUCTION PAPER

The contribution of a reproduction paper lies in analyses of and in insights into existing methods and problems—plus the added certainty that comes with validating previous results or the information that certain results are not reproducible. A strong reproduction paper offers analysis and deepens our understanding of the methodology used or problem approached, helping practitioners choose techniques / resources.



RESOURCE PAPER

Papers in this track present a new language resource. This could be a corpus, but also could be an annotation standard, tool, and so on. Part of the contribution of a reproduction paper lies in the quality, accessibility and description of resources.



POSITION PAPER

A position paper presents a challenge to conventional thinking or a futuristic new vision. It could open up a new area or spur the development of novel technology, propose changes in existing research practices, or give a new set of ground rules. Creative and sound positions will do best, with well-defined visions opening up new areas of research.



SURVEY PAPER

A survey paper provides a structured overview of the literature to date on a specific topic that helps the reader understand the kinds of questions being asked about the topic, the various approaches that have been applied, how they relate to each other, and what further research areas they open up. A conference-length survey paper should be about a sufficiently focused topic that it can do this successfully with in the page limits.



Author Responsibilities

Papers must be of original, previously-unpublished work. The formatting template must be strictly adhered to and deadlines met. Papers must be anonymized to support double-blind reviewing. If the paper is available as a preprint, this must be indicated in the submission form but not in the paper itself.  In addition, COLING 2018 will follow the same policy as ACL 2018 establishing an anonymity period (February 16-author notification) during which non-anonymous posting of preprints is not allowed. Also included in that policy are instructions to reviewers to not rate papers down for not citing recent preprints.



Papers that have been or will be under consideration for other venues at the same time must indicate this at submission time. If a paper is accepted for publication at COLING, it must be immediately withdrawn from other venues. If a paper under review at COLING is accepted elsewhere and authors intend to proceed there, the COLING committee must be notified immediately.



Multilingual Abstracts/Synopses

For the camera-ready papers, we will invite authors to provide a translation of the title and abstract and a 1-2 page synopsis of the paper in a second language of the authors’ choice.  Appropriate languages include but are not limited to authors’ native languages, languages spoken in the authors’ place of affiliation, and languages that are the focus of the research presented.



Writing Mentoring Program

COLING 2018 is offering a writing mentoring program. Authors wishing to participate must submit an abstract by February 16, 2018 and a complete draft of their paper by February 23, 2018. Further information is available at: http://coling2018.org/writing-mentoring-program/

 Finite-State Methods and Natural Language Processing FSMNLP 2009

                Second Call for Papers



 ** Submission deadline for full papers extended to 13 April **



             Eight International Workshop

          University of Pretoria, South Africa

              http://fsmnlp2009.fastar.org (http://fsmnlp2009.fastar.org/)



                   21-24 July 2009



 As in 2008, FSMNLP is merged with the FASTAR (Finite Automata

 Systems Theoretical and Applied Research) workshop.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



                        SCOPE

                        =====

AIM



The International Workshop Series of Finite State Methods and Natural

Language Processing (FSMNLP) is a forum for researchers and

practitioners working on

 - NLP applications or language/ language technology research resources,

 - theoretical and implementation aspects, or

 - their combinations

having *obvious relevance or an explicitly discussed relation* to

Finite-State Methods in NLP.



In the past, seven FSMNLP workshops have been organised (Budapest

1996, Ankara 1998, Helsinki 2001, Budapest 2003, Helsinki 2005,

Potsdam 2007, Ispra 2008).



We invite submissions related to all obvious or traditional FSMNLP

topics, see e.g. FSMNLP 2008. The updated list of topics includes

 - all the obvious or traditional topics

 - plus some new topics such as:

   * common interfaces, portability, and shared methods for testing/

     benchmarking/evaluation of finite-state tools

   * coping with large alphabets during finite-state compilation and

     in real-word applications

   * fixed parameter tractability and narrowness in streamed NLP

   * conventional/parallel algorithms using/manipulating

     conventional/stochastic finite-state automata/paths

   * applications of rational kernels to active/statistical machine

     learning of finite-state models.



SPECIAL THEME



In recognition of its location on the African continent, this year's

FSMNLP has Finite-State Methods for Under-Resourced Languages as a

special theme. The theme is relevant to finite-state methods



 - applied to practical tasks such as language survey, elicitation,

  data collection, computer-aided annotation, morphological

  description, modelling and normalization,

 - considering demanding conditions such as linguistic complexity

  and diversity, scarce resources, research infrastructures, real-

  time grammar updates,

 - in language processing fields such as comparative linguistics,

  field linguistics, applied linguistics, language teaching, and

  computer-aided translation.



The special theme does not restrict the scope but attempts to draw the

attention of contributors to the challenges of computational

linguistics in Africa. We hope that the theme teases out promising and

useful applications of Finite-State Methods in this context.



                        SPECIAL SESSIONS

                        ================



RELATED EVENTS



To catalyze discussion and participation, three special sessions or

subworkshops will be organized, containing presentations of regular

papers and extended abstracts presenting ongoing research, tutorials,

competitions etc. relating to the following topic areas:



1. ""Finite-State Methods for African and other Under-Resourced/

 Low-Density Languages""



Under-resourced/low-density languages, including many African

languages, often require documentation and language development, in

particular including methods for field linguistics, localized

information technology and basic language resources. However, the

conditions for applying large scale statistical methods do not hold in

general, while existing knowledge-based methods may not directly

generalise to low-density languages. The purpose of this subworkshop

is to take a fresh look at new resources, methods, collaboration and

innovative approaches for these (clusters of) languages. Submissions

may be concerned with the following aspects of the subworkshop topic:



 - project proposals and joint projects

 - basic language resources

 - innovative approaches to language clusters

 - field linguistics and language documentation

 - iterative language description

 - resource-efficient machine learning.



The local organizers are Laurette Pretorius and Sonja Bosch. The

subworkshop is tentatively accompanied by two tutorials given by Kemal

Oflazer and Colin de la Higuera (see TUTORIALS AND INVITED TALKS

below).



2. ""Practical Aspects and Experience of FS Methods and Systems""



The last decade has seen a significant increase in the number of

toolkits and implementations of finite state systems for NLP. Work on

such implementations has highlighted a wide variety of implementation

issues. Unfortunately much of this knowledge remains trade-secret or

is only embodied in implementations themselves, and is not presented

academically at conferences. This special session focuses on such

issues and knowledge and covers the following topics (as they relate

to NLP and real-life implementation issues):



 - user interfaces, visualisation, tracing and debugging

 - specification formalisms and languages (e.g. grammars, regular

     relations, etc.)

 - application programmer interfaces, interchange formats

 - performance, profiling and tuning techniques

 - classification, comparison and evaluation

 - data-structures and representations

 - compression of alphabets, lexicons and rules



3. ""Tree Automata and Transducers""



In recent years, applications of formal tree language theory in

natural language processing have been on the rise, as witnessed by

papers at conferences and in journals on formal language theory,

finite automata, natural language processing, and computational

linguistics. FSMNLP 2009 will therefore have a special session/

subworkshop on tree automata and tree transducers in natural

language processing.



This subworkshop includes (but is not limited to) the following topics

as long as they relate to natural language processing:



 - unweighted and weighted tree languages,

 - unweighted and weighted tree transformations,

 - the formalisms to represent and model them (including a.o. tree

     grammars, tree automata, tree expressions, tree transducers),

 - expressiveness of such models and representations,

 - relations to synchronous grammars,

 - learning of such models and representations,

 - algorithms for pattern matching, accepting, parsing of tree

     languages, and

 - large-scale applications (including those in statistical machine

     translation).



For each of the three subworkshops, a subcommittee of the PC supported

by further experts from the field is responsible for the program.

Please refer to the FSMNLP website for the lists of subcommittee

members and further experts.



TUTORIALS AND INVITED TALKS



We expect to have tutorials on the following tentative topics:



 - ""Developing Computational Morphology for Low- and Middle-Density

    Languages"" by Kemal Oflazer (Sabanci University, Turkey)

 - ""Machine Learning with Automata"" by Colin de la Higuera

    (Jean Monnet University, Saint-Etienne, France)

 - ""OpenFST"" by Johan Schalkwyk (Google, USA)



The INVITED SPEAKERS will be announced soon.



COMPETITIONS



During FSMNLP 2009, we hope to announce a small competition / shared

task related to machine learning of morphology.



BUSINESS MEETING



FSMNLP will tentatively have a slot for a SIGFSM business meeting.

SIGFSM is currently in the final stages of formal approval as a

Special Interest Group in the Association for Computational

Linguistics (ACL).



                        SUBMISSION

                        ==========



PAPER CATEGORIES AND FORMATS



We invite submissions of full papers i.e. scientific

contributions presenting new theoretical or experimental

results. Papers should present original, unpublished research results

and should not be submitted elsewhere simultaneously.



We also invite submission of extended abstracts containing or

describing systems descriptions/demos, progress reports/ongoing work,

joint projects/project proposals, small focused contributions,

negative results, and opinion pieces, related to either of the

subworkshop themes or the broader FSMNLP themes.



We particularly invite demo submissions, which should consist of an

extended abstract of the technical content with authors (!), full

contact information, references, acknowledgements, plus a ""script

outline"" of the presentation and a detailed description of hardware,

software and internet requirements.



Note that the early acceptance notification date for full papers may

help to keep travel costs for international participants reasonably

low. If you come from far away and have only an extended abstract, the

abstract can be submitted earlier as if it were a full paper.



The information about the author(s) should be omitted in the submitted

papers since the review process wil be double blind, except for demo

submissions. Submissions are electronic and in PDF format via a

web-based submission server.



Authors are encouraged to use Springer LNCS style (Proceedings and

Other Multiauthor Volumes) for LaTeX in producing the PDF

document. For graph visualization, Vaucanson-G LaTeX style,

Graphviz/dot and XFig are recommended. If you use a non-roman script

or Microsoft Word, it is advisable to warn the organizers as early as

possible. The page limit is 12 pages for full papers and 8 pages for

extended abstracts.



PROCEEDINGS AND SPECIAL JOURNAL ISSUE



The on-site proceedings will be on CD.



The actual proceedings with revised regular papers will be published

after the conference in a volume of Lecture Notes in Artificial

Intelligence as a part of the LNCS Series by Springer-Verlag.



High quality extended abstracts may be invited to be included in the

LNCS postproceedings, while other extended abstracts may be

published as arranged by subworkshop organizers.



In addition, a special journal issue on Finite-State Methods and

Models in NLP is being planned. Extended versions of the papers and

abstracts may be submitted to this special issue (the publication

involves a second review/selection cycle).

  7th WORKSHOP ON BUILDING AND USING COMPARABLE CORPORA



  Building Resources for Machine Translation Research



  http://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2014/



  May 27, 2014

  Co-located with LREC 2014

  Harpa Conference Centre, Reykjavik (Iceland) 



  DEADLINE FOR PAPERS: February 10, 2014

  https://www.softconf.com/lrec2014/BUCC2014/



============================================================



MOTIVATION



In the language engineering and the linguistics communities, research

in comparable corpora has been motivated by two main reasons. In

language engineering, on the one hand, it is chiefly motivated by the

need to use comparable corpora as training data for statistical

Natural Language Processing applications such as statistical machine

translation or cross-lingual retrieval. In linguistics, on the other

hand, comparable corpora are of interest in themselves by making

possible inter-linguistic discoveries and comparisons. It is generally

accepted in both communities that comparable corpora are documents in

one or several languages that are comparable in content and form in

various degrees and dimensions. We believe that the linguistic

definitions and observations related to comparable corpora can improve

methods to mine such corpora for applications of statistical NLP. As

such, it is of great interest to bring together builders and users of

such corpora.

 

The scarcity of parallel corpora has motivated research concerning

the use of comparable corpora: pairs of monolingual corpora selected

according to the same set of criteria, but in different languages

or language varieties. Non-parallel yet comparable corpora overcome

the two limitations of parallel corpora, since sources for original,

monolingual texts are much more abundant than translated texts.

However, because of their nature, mining translations in comparable

corpora is much more challenging than in parallel corpora. What

constitutes a good comparable corpus, for a given task or per se,

also requires specific attention: while the definition of a parallel

corpus is fairly straightforward, building a non-parallel corpus

requires control over the selection of source texts in both languages.



Parallel corpora are a key resource as training data for statistical

machine translation, and for building or extending bilingual lexicons

and terminologies. However, beyond a few language pairs such as

English- French or English-Chinese and a few contexts such as

parliamentary debates or legal texts, they remain a scarce resource,

despite the creation of automated methods to collect parallel corpora

from the Web. To exemplify such issues in a practical setting, this

year's special focus will be on



    Building Resources for Machine Translation Research



This special topic aims to address the need for:

(1) Machine Translation training and testing data such as spoken or

written monolingual, comparable or parallel data collections, and

(2) methods and tools used for collecting, annotating, and verifying

MT data such as Web crawling, crowdsourcing, tools for language

experts and for finding MT data in comparable corpora.





TOPICS



We solicit contributions including but not limited to the following topics:



Topics related to the special theme:

  * Methods and tools for collecting and processing MT data,

        including crowdsourcing

  * Methods and tools for quality control

  * Tools for efficient annotation

  * Bilingual term and named entity collections

  * Multilingual treebanks, wordnets, propbanks, etc.

  * Comparable corpora with parallel units annotated

  * Comparable corpora for under-resourced languages and specific domains

  * Multilingual corpora with rich annotations:

        POS tags, NEs, dependencies, semantic roles, etc.

  * Data for special applications: patent translation, movie

        subtitles, MOOCs, meetings, chat-rooms, social media, etc.

  * Legal issues with collecting and redistributing data

        and generating derivatives



Building comparable corpora:

  * Human translations

  * Automatic and semi-automatic methods

  * Methods to mine parallel and non-parallel corpora from the Web

  * Tools and criteria to evaluate the comparability of corpora

  * Parallel vs non-parallel corpora, monolingual corpora

  * Rare and minority languages, across language families

  * Multi-media/multi-modal comparable corpora



Applications of comparable corpora:

  * Human translations

  * Language learning

  * Cross-language information retrieval & document categorization

  * Bilingual projections

  * Machine translation

  * Writing assistance



Mining from comparable corpora:

  * Extraction of parallel segments or paraphrases from comparable corpora

  * Extraction of bilingual and multilingual translations of single words

        and multi-word expressions; proper names, named entities, etc.

The workshop will also give special attention on the wide variety of initiatives for the creation, use, and evaluation of Arabic as a type of Asian Language Resources and Technologies, which is one of LREC 2018 hot topics. In addition to the general topics of CL, NLP and IR, the workshop will give a special emphasis on a new Arabic Data challenge track.



Data Challenge Track

This year, we are introducing ArabicWeb16, a new Web dataset that is suitable for many research projects. ArabicWeb16 is a public Web crawl of 150M Arabic Web pages, crawled over the month of January 2016, with high coverage of dialectal Arabic (about 21%) as well as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). One goal of the workshop is to define shared challenges using this dataset. We encourage submissions describing experiments for research tasks on the dataset. This includes (but not limited to) training word-embeddings, deduplication, cross-dialect search, question answering, dialect detection, knowledge-base population, entity search, blog search, text classification, and spam detection. Further details, including instructions on how to obtain the dataset, can be found here (https://sites.google.com/view/arabicweb16).



Topics of interest



*Corpora



Surveying and criticizing the design of available Arabic corpora, their associated and processing tools.

Availing new annotated corpora for NLP and IR applications such as named entity recognition, machine translation, sentiment analysis, text classification, and language learning.

Evaluating the use of crowdsourcing platforms for Arabic data annotation.



* Tools and Technologies



Language education e.g. L1 and L2.

Language modeling and word embeddings.

Tokenization, normalization, word segmentation, morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging, etc.

SUBMISSIONS



Long papers



EMNLP 2015 submissions must describe substantial, original, completed

and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and

analysis should be included. Each submission will be reviewed by at

least three program committee members.



Each long paper submission consists of a paper of up to eight (8)

pages of content, plus two pages for references. Final versions of

long papers will be given one additional page (up to 9 pages with 2

pages for references) so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into

account.



Short papers



EMNLP 2015 also solicits short papers. Short paper submissions must

describe original and unpublished work. While a short paper is not a

shortened long paper, the characteristics of short papers include:



- A small, focused contributiond

- Work in progress

- A negative result

- An opinion piece

- An interesting application nugget



Each short paper submission consists of up to four (4) pages of

content, plus 2 pages for references. Upon acceptance, short papers

will be given five (5) pages in the proceedings and 2 pages for

references. Final versions of short papers will also be given one

additional page (up to 5 pages with 2 pages for references), so that

reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.



Both long and short papers



Papers may be accompanied by the resources (software and/or data)

described in the papers. Papers that are submitted with accompanying

software/data may receive additional credit toward the overall

evaluation score, and the potential impact of the software and data

will be taken into account when making the acceptance/rejection

decisions.



Accepted papers will be presented orally or as a poster (at the

discretion of the program chairs). There will be no distinction in the

proceedings between papers presented orally or as posters.





Formatting



Both long and short papers should follow the two-column format to be

provided at the conference site:



http://www.emnlp2015.org/submissions.html



We reserve the right to reject submissions if the paper does not

conform to these styles, including paper size and font size

restrictions.



As the reviewing will be blind, papers should not include the authors'

names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the

author's identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...”,

should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith (1991)

previously showed ...”. Submissions that do not conform to these

requirements will be rejected without review. Separate author

identification information is required as part of the on-line

submission process.



We are now accepting long and short paper submissions on SoftConf:



https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2015/papers



To minimize network congestion we request authors upload their

submissions as early as possible.



EMNLP multiple submission policy



Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or

publications must indicate this at submission time, and must be

withdrawn from the other venues if accepted by EMNLP 2015.  We will

not accept for publication or presentation papers that overlap

significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have

been) published elsewhere.



Authors submitting more than one paper to EMNLP 2015 must ensure that

submissions do not overlap significantly ()25%) with each other in

content or results.



Preprint servers such as arXiv.org and ACL-related workshops that do

not have published proceedings in the ACL Anthology are not considered

archival for purposes of submission. Authors must state in the online

submission form the name of the workshop or preprint server and title

of the non-archival version. The submitted version should be suitably

anonymized and not contain references to the prior non-archival

version. Reviewers will be told: ""The author(s) have notified us that

there exists a non-archival previous version of this paper with

significantly overlapping text. We have approved submission under

these circumstances, but to preserve the spirit of blind review, the

current submission does not reference the non-archival version.""

Reviewers are free to do what they like with this information.



PRESENTATION REQUIREMENT



All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in

the proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper must

register for EMNLP 2015.

***NEW***: submission deadline extended to October 2nd, 23:59 UTC-12:00.



http://malvinanissim.github.io/PEOPLES 



Co-located with COLING 2016, Osaka, Japan





On social media, users nowadays freely express what is on their mind at any moment in time, at any location, and about virtually anything. These large amounts of spontaneously produced texts open up a unique opportunity to learn more about such users, e.g., predicting demographic variables (age, gender), but also personality types, as well as emotions and opinion expressions. Aspects of human personality and behavior have been mostly studied in isolation, often in different - but related - communities. We believe that the time is ripe to bring these communities a step closer, to study people’s traits and expressions jointly and in their interplay.



On a conceptual level we can view these aspects on a continuum of stability, where some can be considered stable (e.g., gender), while others are of more transitional nature and contextually prompted (e.g., emotions). They can be seen as characterizing traits of the whole person and should be studied together. As of now, however, little is known on how they interact with one another in computational language modeling, or how they can inform each other in modeling people or improving natural language processing tools.



This workshop intends to bring together researchers in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing who share an interest in personality, opinion and emotion detection, and especially in researching the intertwining of such traits and expressions.



We encourage the submission of long (8 pages) and short (4 pages) research papers, including opinion statements. We especially welcome views from different fields on how to treat the different aspects. We welcome submissions related but not limited to the following topics:



- opinion, personality and emotion detection in social media

- predicting demographic variables and author traits (gender, age, personality)

- opinions, personality and emotions and their interactions

- interaction between personality, opinion and emotions with demographic variables (age, gender)

- interaction between personality, opinion and emotions and geo-spatial information (geographic locations and places)

- interaction between personality, opinion and emotions with politics

- personality, opinion and emotions and social network analysis

- modeling of personality, opinion and emotions from a multimodal perspective

- exploitation of the different degree of stability of the various traits

- reflections on the definition of personal traits

- applications of predictive modeling of user traits

- on the ethics of predictive modeling of social variables



Paper Submission



Standard research papers should be a maximum of 8 pages long, plus two extra pages for references. We also encourage submission of short papers of maximum 4 pages long, plus two extra pages for references. All papers should be electronically submitted in PDF format via the START system: 



https://www.softconf.com/coling2016/PEOPLES 



Submissions must be anonymous and follow the Coling 2016 formatting guidelines.

Proceedings:

============

Contributions will be included in the Companion volume of the ACM

WWW2015 conference, which will be published by ACM and included

in the ACM Digital Library.



However, to make that happen at least one author of the accepted

paper has to register. At the time of submission of the final

camera-ready copy, authors will have to indicate the already

registered person for that publication.



Any paper published by the ACM, IEEE, etc. which can be properly

cited constitutes research which must be considered in judging the

novelty of a WWW submission, whether the published paper was in a

conference, journal, or workshop. Therefore, any paper previously

published as part of a WWW workshop must be referenced and suitably

extended with new content to qualify as a new submission to the

Research Track at the WWW conference.



Submission guidelines:

======================

All submitted papers must

    * be written in English;

    * contain author names, affiliations, and email addresses;

    * be formatted according to the ACM SIG Proceedings template

    (http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates)

    with a font size no smaller than 9pt;

    * be in PDF (make sure that the PDF can be viewed on any

    platform), and formatted for US Letter size;

    * occupy no more than six pages, including the abstract,

    references, and appendices.



It is the authors responsibility to ensure that their submissions

adhere strictly to the required format.

Submissions that do not comply with the above guidelines may be

rejected without review.





Workshop sponsorship:

=====================

The organisation of this workshop is partially supported by the PHEME European Commission funded project No. 611233 (http://www.pheme.eu/). 



Please get in touch with the workshop organisers, if you would like to become a sponsor.

The Computational Linguistics – Applications Conference was established in 2008 as the Workshop for its first three editions in response to the fast-paced progress in the area, to create a dialog between researchers and practitioners involved in Computational Linguistics and related areas of Information Technology.



Traditionally, computational linguistics was limited to the scientists specialized in the processing of a natural language by computers. Scientific approaches and practical techniques come from linguistics, computer science, psychology, and mathematics. Nowadays, there is a number of practical applications available. These applications are sometimes developed by smart yet NLP-untrained developers who solve the problems using sophisticated heuristics. CLA aims to be a meeting place for both parties in order to share views and ideas. It will help scientist to better understand real world needs and practitioners not to reinvent the wheel.



Computational Linguistics needs to be applied to make the full use of the Internet. There is a definite need for software that can handle unstructured text and information to allow search for information on the web. The priority aim of the research in this area is to enable users to communicate with the computer in their native language.



CLA'11 Conference is a place where the parties meet to exchange views and ideas with a benefit to all involved. The Conference will focus on practical outcome of modeling human language use and the applications needed to improve human-machine interaction.

What is Considered “Unpublished Work”?

All prior peer-reviewed publications, either at a conference or workshop, are considered published prior work. Preprints such as those on arXiv.org and technical reports that are not peer reviewed are not considered prior published work for purposes of submission. Authors must state in the online submission form the name of the workshop or preprint server and title of the non-archival version. The version submitted to NAACL HLT should be suitably anonymized and not contain references to the prior non-archival version. Reviewers will be told: “The author(s) have notified us that there exists a non-archival previous version of this paper with significantly overlapping text. We have approved submission under these circumstances, but to preserve the spirit of blind review, the current submission does not reference the non-archival version.” Reviewers are free to do what they like with this information.

 Date of Workshop: 8 August, 2013



Deadline for submissions: April 28, 2013



The Second Workshop on Predicting and Improving Text Readability for Target Reader Populations Workshop will be be held in conjunction with the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) 2013 conference, 4 - 9 August, 2013, at the National Palace of Culture, Sofia, Bulgaria.





CALL FOR PAPERS

Many NLP systems generate or reformulate human language but how readable is the output? What makes language easy or difficult to read for different types of readers? How can existing text be manipulated to improve information access? How does writing style affect readability, comprehension, and appreciation of text? The last few years have seen a resurgence of interest in these questions amongst computational linguists as attention turns to more sophisticated techniques for textual presentation and to address the widely differing needs of end users. The relevance of this research area has spawned a number of workshops on related topics, for example, SL-PAT 2012 (slpat.org) and NLP4ITA 2012 (www.taln.upf.edu/nlp4ita/), and a new special interest group, Speech and Language Processing for Assistive Technologies (slpat.org), which sponsors this workshop.

PITR is a cross-disciplinary workshop bringing together researchers in any field concerned with the readability, accessibility and quality of text, particularly computational linguists, psycholinguists and educational researchers. We solicit papers on:

	•	Reformulation of existing text (text-to-text systems)

	•	Generation of readable language from data (data-to-text systems)

	•	Generation of text in specific styles and registers for readability

	•	Evaluation of language simplification strategies

	•	Evaluation of the readability of computer-generated text

	•	Evaluation of the readability of machine translation output

	•	Prediction of aspects of text style related to readability

	•	Prediction of the readability of documents

	•	Readability issues in specialist texts such as questionnaires, exam questions, safety instructions, etc.

	•	Novel evaluation strategies for assessing text readability

	•	Novel readability metrics

	•	Techniques for simplifying lexis

	•	Techniques for simplifying syntax

	•	Techniques for simplifying discourse properties (making text more transparent, etc.)

	•	Techniques for manipulating textual layout to improve accessibility

	•	Techniques for making descriptions of numerical quantities more accessible

	•	Techniques for making technical terminology more accessible

	•	Techniques for making descriptions of logical statements more accessible

	•	Techniques for explaining complex ideas through accessible text

	•	Systems aimed at adults with poor literacy

	•	Systems aimed at children learning to read

	•	Systems aimed at 2nd language learners

	•	Systems aimed at people with language deficits (aphasia, deafness, neurodegeneration, etc.)

	•	Systems aimed at non-experts accessing technical material





SUBMISSIONS

Papers should prepared in ACL format not exceeding 8 pages in length plus up to 2 additional pages for references. Papers should also be anonymised for blind reviewing. Whilst only certain authors will be invited to give oral presentations, all accepted authors will be expected to present a poster. Last year, the poster session was very lively, giving poster-only authors and oral-presentation authors ample opportunities to discuss their research.

ACL-IJCNLP 2021 also solicits short papers. Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages. Some kinds of short papers are:



- A small, focused contribution

- A negative result

- An opinion piece

- An interesting application nugget



Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited pages of references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given five (5) content pages in the proceedings. Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address reviewers' comments in their final versions.



Short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers presented orally and as posters.



IMPORTANT: Anonymity Period

The following rules and guidelines are meant to protect the integrity of double-blind review and ensure that submissions are reviewed fairly. The rules make reference to the anonymity period, which runs from 1 month before the submission deadline (starting January 1, 2021 11:59PM UTC-12:00) up to the date when your paper is either accepted, rejected, or withdrawn (May 5, 2021). Papers that are withdrawn during this period will no longer be subject to these rules.



You may not make a non-anonymized version of your paper available online to the general community (for example, via a preprint server) during the anonymity period. By a version of a paper we understand another paper having essentially the same scientific content but possibly differing in minor details (including title and structure) and/or in length.

If you have posted a non-anonymized version of your paper online before the start of the anonymity period, you may submit an anonymized version to the conference. The submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version, and you must inform the program chair(s) that a non-anonymized version exists.

You may not update the non-nonymized version during the anonymity period, and we ask you not to advertise it on social media or take other actions that would further compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period.

Note that, while you are not prohibited from making a non-anonymous version available online before the start of the anonymity period, this does make double-blind reviewing more difficult to maintain, and we therefore encourage you to wait until the end of the anonymity period if possible. Alternatively, you may consider submitting your work to the Computational Linguistics journal, which does not require anonymization and has a track for “short” (i.e., conference-length) papers."

	       Building and Using Comparable Corpora



		 LREC 2008 post-conference workshop

			 Marrakech, Morocco

			    31 May 2008

http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/IMG/ws/cfp-lrec2008-comparable-corpora.pdf	



CONTEXT AND FOCUS



  Research in comparable corpora is motivated by the scarcity of

  parallel corpora. Parallel corpora are a key resource to mine

  translations for statistical machine translation or for building

  or extending bilingual lexicons and terminologies. However, beyond

  a few language pairs such as English-French or English-Chinese and

  a few contexts such as parliamentary debates or legal texts, they

  remain a scarce resource, despite the creation of automated

  methods to collect parallel corpora from the Web. A more

  fundamental limitation is that translated texts, whatever the

  skills of translators, are generally influenced by the very

  translation process and by the language of source texts, so that

  they may not be fully adequate for the task at hand.



  This has motivated research into the use of comparable corpora:

  pairs of monolingual corpora selected according to the same set of

  criteria, but in different languages or language

  varieties. Comparable corpora overcome the two limitations of

  parallel corpora, since sources for original, monolingual texts

  are much more abundant than translated texts. However, because of

  their nature, mining translations in comparable corpora is much

  more challenging than in parallel corpora. What constitutes a good

  comparable corpus, for a given task or per se, also requires

  specific attention: while the definition of a parallel corpus is

  fairly straightforward, building a comparable corpus requires

  control over the selection of source texts in both languages.





TOPICS



  This workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in the

  constitution and use of comparable corpora. Contributions are

  solicited on the constitution and application of comparable

  corpora, including the following topics:



  Applications of comparable corpora:



    tools for translators;

    tools for language learning;

    cross-language information retrieval;

    cross-language document categorization;

    machine translation;

    monolingual comparable corpora for writing assistance;

    extraction of parallel segments in comparable corpora.



  Units aligned in comparable corpora:



    single words and multi-word expressions;

    proper names;

    alignment across different scripts.



  Constitution of comparable corpora:



    criteria of comparability;

    degree of comparability;

    methods for mining comparable corpora.

SHARED TASK concerning the ‘LEXICAL ACCESS PROBLEM’ (Computing Associations when being given Multiple Stimuli) 



In the framework of the 4th Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of the Lexicon (CogALex) to be held at COLING 2014, we invite participation in a shared task devoted to the problem of lexical access in language production, with the aim of providing a quantitative comparison between different systems.



 

MOTIVATION



The quality of a dictionary depends not only on coverage, but also on the accessibility of the information. That is, a crucial point is dictionary access. Access strategies vary with the task (text understanding vs. text production) and the knowledge available at the very moment of consultation (words, concepts, speech sounds). Unlike readers who look for meanings, writers start from them, searching for the corresponding words. While paper dictionaries are static, permitting only limited strategies for accessing information, their electronic counterparts promise dynamic, proactive search via multiple criteria (meaning, sound, related words) and via diverse access routes. Navigation takes place in a huge conceptual lexical space, and the results are displayable in a multitude of forms (e.g. as trees, as lists, as graphs, or sorted alphabetically, by topic, by frequency).



To bring some structure into this multitude of possibilities, the shared task will concentrate on a crucial subtask, namely multiword association.  What we mean by this in the context of this workshop is the following. Suppose, we were looking for a word expressing the following ideas: 'superior dark coffee made of beans from Arabia', but could not remember the intended word 'mocha' due to the tip-of-the-tongue problem. Since people always remember something concerning the elusive word, it would be nice to have a system accepting this kind of input, to propose then a number of candidates for the target word. Given the above example, we might enter 'dark', 'coffee', 'beans', and 'Arabia', and the system would be supposed to come up with one or several associated words such as 'mocha', 'espresso', or 'cappuccino'.



 

TASK DEFINITION



The participants will receive lists of five given words (primes) such as 'circus', 'funny', 'nose', 'fool', and 'fun' and are supposed to compute the word which is most closely associated to all of them. In this case, the word 'clown' would be the expected response. Here are some more examples:



   given words:  gin, drink, scotch, bottle, soda

   target word:  whisky



   given words:  wheel, driver, bus, drive, lorry

   target word:  car



   given words:  neck, animal, zoo, long, tall

   target word:  giraffe



   given words:  holiday, work, sun, summer, abroad

   target word:  vacation



   given words:  home, garden, door, boat, chimney

   target word:  house



   given words:  blue, cloud, stars, night, high

   target word:  sky



We will provide a training set of 2000 sets of five input words (multiword stimuli), together with the expected target words (associative responses). The participants will have about five weeks to train their systems on this data. After the training phase, we will release a test set containing another 2000 sets of five input words, but without providing the expected target words. 



Participants will have five days to run their systems on the test data, thereby predicting the target words. For each system, we will compare the results to the expected target words and compute an accuracy. The participants will be invited to submit a paper describing their approach and their results.



For the participating systems, we will distinguish two categories: 



(1) Unrestricted systems. They can use any kind of data to compute their results. 

(2) Restricted systems: These systems are only allowed to draw on the freely available ukWaC corpus in order to extract information on word associations. The ukWaC corpus comprises about 2 billion words and can be downloaded from http://wacky.sslmit.unibo.it/doku.php?id=corpora. 



Participants are allowed to compete in either category or in both.





VENUE



The shared task will take place as part of the CogALex workshop which is co-located with COLING 2014 (Dublin). The workshop date is August 23, 2014. Shared task participants who wish to have a paper published in the workshop proceedings will be required to present their work at the workshop.

WORKSHOP SCOPE



Based on the success of past low-resource machine translation (MT) workshops at AACL-IJCNLP 2020 (http://aacl2020.org/), MT Summit 2019 (https://www.mtsummit2019.com) and AMTA 2018 (https://amtaweb.org/), we introduce the fourth LoResMT workshop at MT Summit 2021. Like its predecessors, this workshop will bring together researchers and translators of low-resource languages to compare and contrast how each uses digital technology for translation. Specifically, the workshop focuses on novel advances on the coverage of even more languages than past workshops with different geographical presence, degree of diffusion, and digitalization.



We solicit original work on low-resource translation which includes, but is not limited to, MT systems that include word tokenizers/de-tokenizers, word segmenters, morphological analyzers, and more. We furthermore invite work that includes MT systems based on neural networks along with their methods, natural language processing approaches, and overall coverage of low-resource languages. Additionally, novel work covering translations of COVID-related text and their practical use for low-resource communities is of high interest.



The goal of this workshop is to begin to close the gap between low-resource translation systems and their practical use in the real world. Online systems and original research that can be used by native speakers of low-resource languages is of particular interest. Therefore, It will be beneficial if the evaluations of these tools in research papers include their impact on the quality of MT output and how they can be used in the real world.



TOPICS



We are highly interested in (1) original research papers, (2) review/opinion papers, and (3) online systems on the topics below; however, we welcome all novel ideas that cover research on low-resource languages.

- COVID-related corpora, their translations and corresponding NLP/MT systems

- Neural machine translation for low-resource languages

- Work that presents online systems for practical use by native speakers

- Word tokenizers/de-tokenizers for specific languages

- Word/morpheme segmenters for specific languages

- Alignment/Re-ordering tools for specific language pairs

- Use of morphology analyzers and/or morpheme segmenters in MT

- Multilingual/cross-lingual NLP tools for MT

- Corpora creation and curation technologies for low-resource languages

- Review of available parallel corpora for low-resource languages

- Research and review papers of MT methods for low-resource languages

- MT systems/methods (e.g. rule-based, SMT, NMT) for low-resource languages

- Pivot MT for low-resource languages

- Zero-shot MT for low-resource languages

- Fast building of MT systems for low-resource languages

- Re-usability of existing MT systems for low-resource languages

- Machine translation for language preservation



SUBMISSION INFORMATION



We are soliciting two types of submissions. For research, review, and position papers, the length of each paper should be at least four (4) and not exceed eight (8) pages, plus unlimited pages for references. For system demonstration papers, the limit is four (4) pages. Submissions should be formatted according to the official MT Summit 2021 style templates (PDF, LaTeX, Word). Accepted papers will be published online in the MT Summit 2021 proceedings and will be presented at the conference either orally or as a poster.



Submissions must be anonymized and should be done using the official conference management system (https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MTSUMMIT2021). Scientific papers that have been or will be submitted to other venues must be declared as such, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted and published at LoResMT. The review will be double-blind.

FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS



The European Language Resource Association (ELRA) is glad to announce the 11th edition of LREC, organised with the support of international organisations – many from Asia: the Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing (AFNLP), Oriental COCOSDA, the Association of Natural Language Processing - Japan, the Chinese Information Processing Society of China, the Linguistic Data Consortium,...



CONFERENCE AIMS

LREC is the major event on Language Resources (LRs) and Evaluation for Human Language Technologies (HLT). LREC aims to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art, explore new R&D directions and emerging trends, exchange information regarding LRs and their applications, evaluation methodologies and tools, communicate on-going and planned activities, identify industrial uses and needs, and address requirements from e-science and e-society, with respect to scientific, technology, policy and organisational issues.



For this edition, LREC goes East in order to support a stronger interaction and synergy with the Asian NLP community and to help promoting Asian Language Resources and Language Technologies.



LREC provides a unique forum for researchers, industrials and funding agencies from a wide spectrum of related disciplines to discuss issues and opportunities, find new synergies and promote initiatives for international cooperation, in support of investigations in language sciences, progress in language technologies (LTs) and development of corresponding products, services and applications, and standards.



CONFERENCE TOPICS

Issues in the design, construction and use of LRs: text, speech, sign, gesture, image, in single or multimodal/multimedia data

* Guidelines, standards, best practices and models for LRs interoperability

* Methodologies and tools for LRs construction and annotation

* Methodologies and tools for extraction and acquisition of knowledge

* Ontologies, terminology and knowledge representation

* LRs and Semantic Web

* LRs and Crowdsourcing

* Metadata for LRs and semantic/content mark-up





Exploitation of LRs in systems and applications

* Sign language, multimedia information and multimodal communication

* LRs in systems and applications such as: information extraction, information retrieval, audio-visual and multimedia search, speech dictation, meeting transcription, Computer Aided Language Learning, training and education, mobile communication, machine translation, speech translation, summarisation, web services, semantic search, text mining, inferencing, reasoning, sentiment analysis/opinion mining, etc.

* Interfaces: (speech-based) dialogue systems, natural language and multimodal/multisensory interactions, voice-activated services, etc.

* Use of (multilingual) LRs in various fields of application like e-government, e-participation, e-culture, e-health, mobile applications, digital humanities, social sciences, etc.

* Industrial LRs requirements

* User needs, LT for accessibility



Issues in LT evaluation

* LT evaluation methodologies, protocols and measures

* Validation and quality assurance of LRs

* Benchmarking of systems and products

* Usability evaluation of HLT-based user interfaces and dialogue systems

* User satisfaction evaluation



General issues regarding LRs & Evaluation

* International and national activities, projects and initiatives

* Priorities, perspectives, strategies in national and international policies for LRs

* Multilingual issues, language coverage and diversity, less-resourced languages

* Open, linked and shared data and tools, open and collaborative architectures

* Replicability and reproducibility issues

* Organisational, economical, ethical and legal issues



LREC 2018 HOT TOPICS



Asian Language Resources

Special attention will be devoted to highlight the wide variety of initiatives for the creation, use and evaluation of Asian Language Resources and Technologies. Special attention will be paid to Less-Resourced Languages in the Asian area, including (local) Sign Languages.



International Contribution to Olympics 2020

LREC 2018 would like to promote all LTs that would support better interactions and communications between the Olympics 2020 visitors and the local hosts. This involves all speech- and text-based computer interactions, speech/sign to speech/sign translations, human-human communications mediated by computers, etc. Assessment of the above mentioned technologies is also an important area within LREC 2018.



Language Resources in the Online World

In a time in which more and more (language) data are generated, either by human beings or by machines, and directly streamed, the question arises how LRs and LTs can cope with this development. A first challenge is to address and to provide for correctives to hate speeches, cyberbullying, fake news, etc. Can LT provide means to process and respond in a timely manner to such language data streamed in a huge amount at high speed? In this context, language technologists have to intensify cooperation with humanities, especially social and political sciences, psychology but also economics, and more.





DESCRIBE AND SHARE YOUR LRs!

In addition to describing your LRs in the LRE Map – now a normal step in the submission procedure of many conferences – LREC recognises the importance of sharing resources and making them available to the community.

When submitting a paper, you will be offered the possibility to share your LRs (data, tools, web-services, etc.), uploading them in a special LREC repository set up by ELRA. Your LRs will be made available to all LREC participants before the conference, to be re-used, compared, analysed. This effort of sharing LRs, linked to the LRE Map for their description, contributes to creating a common repository where everyone can deposit and share data.



PROGRAMME

The Scientific Programme will include invited talks, oral presentations, poster and demo presentations, and panels, in addition to a keynote address by the winner of the Antonio Zampolli Prize.

We will also organise an Industrial Track.



SUBMISSIONS AND DATES

Submission of proposals for oral and poster (or poster+demo) papers: September 25, 2017

* LREC2018 asks for extended abstracts of no less than 3000 words (references excluded), which must strictly follow the LREC stylesheet which will be available on the conference website. Extended abstracts should be submitted through START and will be peer-reviewed.

Submission of proposals for panels, workshops and tutorials: September 25, 2017

* Proposals should be submitted via an online form on the LREC website and will be reviewed by the Programme Committee.



PROCEEDINGS

The Proceedings will include both oral and poster papers, in the same format. Final papers will range from 4 to 8 pages, with no difference in quality between shorter and longer submissions.

There is also no difference in quality between oral and poster presentations. Only the appropriateness of the type of communication (more or less interactive) to the content of the paper will be considered.

The importance of LREC in Natural Language Processing is reflected by the H5-Index citation ranking in Google Scholar: LREC is ranked 3rd among Computational Linguistics conferences. In addition, since 2010, LREC Proceedings are included in the Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index.

Language and Ontologies 2015

Workshop at the 11th International Conference on Computational Semantics (IWCS)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Description

-----------



With the growing importance of Semantic Web technologies, formal ontologies are increasingly used by people with limited or no background in formal logic, creating a significant interest in natural and easily accessible front ends. In addition, the role of ontologies in computational linguistics is recognised as crucial. Global interest in these topics is witnessed by recent projects such as NeOn (Lifecycle Support for Networked Ontologies), LEGO (Lexicon Enhancement via the GOLD Ontology), SWAT (Semantic Web Authoring Tool), PESCaDO (Personalized Environmental Service Configuration and Delivery Orchestration), CO-ODE, and WhatIf (What if... questions for Ontology Authoring).



This workshop aims to create a forum for the many ways in which research on ontologies and research in computational linguistics relate to each other. It aims at bringing together researchers from different communities, including controlled languages and natural language interfaces as well as ontology languages and linguistic ontologies, in order to identify common interests, exploit synergies, and share methods, tools and resources.





Topics of Interest

------------------



* NLP-driven ontology modelling

* Ontology learning and population from text

* Ontology authoring

* Annotation and annotation schemes

* Authoring dialogues

* Psychological studies of errors

* NLP-driven access to ontologies

* Natural language interfaces to ontologies

* Verbalization of ontologies

* Verbalization of query languages

* Ontologies for NLP (e.g. textual entailment, summarisation)

* Ontology-based information retrieval

* Ontologies, folksonomies, and lexicons





Submission Requirements

-----------------------



Papers should be a mamximum of 6 pages long with an additional page allowed for references. 

Papers should be electronically submitted in PDF format via EasyChair (to be arranged). 

Submissions have to be anonymous and follow the IWCS formatting guidelines. 

The deadline for submission is 21st December 2014. 



The accepted papers will be part of the conference proceedings and will be published electronically in the ACL Anthology.

In conjunction with EACL 2017, Valencia, Spain



Sponsored by SIGSLAV: Special Interest Group on Slavic Natural Language Processing of the ACL





DATES



Submission deadline: 16 January 2017



Notification of acceptance: 11 February 2017



Camera-ready papers due: 21 February 2017



Workshop: 3 or 4 April 2017





THEME and MOTIVATION



Languages from the Balto-Slavic group play an important role due to their diverse cultural heritage and widespread use -- with over 400 million speakers worldwide. The recent political and economic developments in Central and Eastern Europe have brought Balto-Slavic societies and their languages into focus in terms of rapid technological advancement and rapidly expanding consumer markets.



This Workshop addresses Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the Balto-Slavic languages. The NLP tasks in urgent need of attention include, but are not limited to:



- morphological analysis and generation,



- morphosyntactic tagging,



- syntactic and semantic parsing,



- lexical semantics,



- named-entity recognition,



- text normalisation and processing non-standard language



- coreference resolution,



- information extraction,



- question answering,



- information retrieval,



- text summarization,



- machine translation,



- development of linguistic resources.



Research on theoretical and applied topics in the context of some of the Balto-Slavic languages is still in its early stages. The linguistic phenomena specific to Balto-Slavic languages -- such as rich morphological inflection and free word order -- make the construction of NLP tools for these languages a challenging and intriguing task.



The goal of this Workshop is to bring together researchers from academia and industry working on NLP for Balto-Slavic languages. In particular, the Workshop will serve to stimulate the research on NLP techniques for Balto-Slavic languages, and to foster the creation of tools and resources for these languages. The Workshop will provide a forum for exchanging ideas and experience, discussing difficult-to-tackle problems, and making the resources that are available more widely-known. One fascinating aspect of this sub-family of languages is the striking structural similarity, as well as an easily recognizable core vocabulary and inflectional inventory spanning the entire group of languages -- despite a lack of mutual intelligibility -- which creates a special environment in which researchers can fully appreciate the shared problems and solutions and communicate naturally.



SUBMISSION:



There will be two types of submissions: long papers and short papers.



Long papers should describe original, unpublished and completed work. Short papers should describe: (a) work in progress and/or small focused contributions, or (b) system demonstrations, new linguistic resources and experience of using existing software and resources, or (c) ongoing projects and activities that are relevant to all stakeholders in the domain of Balto-Slavic NLP.



Overlap with previously published work should be clearly mentioned. The authors should indicate along with their submission if the paper has been submitted elsewhere. In case the paper is rejected by the main conference, it should be indicated in the submission.



All submissions will be judged on correctness, novelty, technical strength, clarity of presentation, usability, and significance/relevance to the Workshop. Submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee.



The reviewing of long papers will be blind. Therefore, long papers should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Self-citations and other references that reveal the authors' identity must be avoided.



In particular, submissions describing systems, resources, or solutions that are made available to the wider public would be strongly encouraged, as this would help to promote computational linguistics applications for Balto-Slavic languages.



Long paper submissions should follow the two-column format of EACL 2017 proceedings not exceeding eight (8) pages of content plus two (2) additional pages for references. Short paper submissions should follow the same format, and should not exceed four (4) pages for content plus two (2) additional pages for references. Submissions must conform to the official style guidelines of EACL 2017, which are contained in the style files (http://eacl2017.org/images/site/eacl-2017-template.zip), and must be in PDF.



Camera-ready versions of accepted papers must be provided both in LaTeX and PDF format.



SHARED TASK



For the first time at BSNLP, we are organi sing a shared task on multilingual named entity recognition aims at recognizing mentions of named entities in web documents 

in Slavic languages, their normalization / lemmatization, and cross-language matching. Further details can be found at:

Call for Papers



Workshop at MT Summit XIV in Nice, France

September 3, 2013



Submission deadline: 26 June 2013 at 24:00 CET (GMT+1)



Machine Translation (MT) has evolved along with different types of computer-assisted translation tools and a notable progress has been achieved in improving the quality of translations. However, in spite of the recent positive developments in translation technologies, not all problems have been solved and in particular the identification, interpretation and translation of multi-word units (MWUs) still represent open challenges, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view. The low standard of analysis and translation of MWUs in translation technologies suggest that there is the need to invest in further research with the goal of improving the performance of the various translation applications.



Multi-word units (MWUs) are a complex linguistic phenomenon, ranging from lexical units with a relatively high degree of internal variability to expressions that are frozen or semi-frozen. Such units are very frequent both in everyday language and in languages for special purposes. Their interpretation and translation sometimes present unexpected obstacles even to human translators, mainly because of intrinsic ambiguities, structural and lexical asymmetries between languages, and, finally, cultural differences.



The current theoretical work on this topic deals with different formalisms and techniques relevant for MWU processing in MT as well as other translation applications, such as: automatic recognition of MWUs in a monolingual or bilingual setting; alignment and paraphrasing methodologies; development, features and usefulness of handcrafted monolingual and bilingual linguistic resources and grammars; use of MWUs in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) domain adaptation, as well as empirical work concerning their modelling accuracy and descriptive adequacy across various language pairs. At the practical level, the issue of MWU has been addressed in various MT approaches, whether knowledge-based, statistical (word-based, phrase-based or factored-based) or hybrid. In general, MWU identification and translation problems are far from being solved and there is still considerable room for improvement. There is a recent growing attention to MWU processing in MT and Translation Technologies, as it has been acknowledged that it is not possible to create large-scale applications without properly handling MWUs of all kinds.



The focus of this workshop is to address the MWU issue in a synergetic way, taking advantage of the recent developments in disciplines such as Linguistics, Translation Studies, Computational Linguistics, and Computational Phraseology.



The main aim of the Workshop is, therefore, to bring together researchers working on various aspects of MWU processing in different disciplines, in order to discuss and propose innovative ideas and methods in relation to MT and Translation Technologies. In particular, this workshop welcomes the exchange of interactions between researchers in NLP working on the computational treatment of multi-word units, experts in phraseology (including computational phraseology) working on challenging topics of their discipline, as well as translation practitioners, to the benefit of applying their latest results to advance the state of the art in MWU translation.

TOPICS



We invite the submissions of papers reporting original and unpublished research on multi-word unit (MWU) processing in Machine Translation and Translation Technologies. We encourage the representation of a broad range of areas including, but not limited to, the following:



    Lexical, syntactic, semantic and translational aspects in MWU representation

    Identification and acquisition of multi-word terms and their variants

    Automatic extraction of (multilingual) MWU resources

    MWUs in Computer-Assisted Translation

    Development and use of handcrafted MWU linguistic resources in MT

    Paraphrasing of MWUs applied to improving MT

    MWUs and word alignment techniques

    Identification and acquisition of non-compositional items

    Learning semantic information about MWUs from monolingual, parallel or comparable corpora

    Multilingualism and MWU processing

    Integration of MWUs into rule-based and statistical MT

    MT evaluation focused on MWUs and novel automatic metrics handling MWUs

    Creation of MWU-annotated corpora with a focus on translation aspects

11th WORKSHOP ON BUILDING AND USING COMPARABLE CORPORA



Co-located with LREC 2018, Phoenix Seagaia Resort, Miyazaki, Japan



Tuesday, May 8, 2018



Submission deadline: January 20, 2018



SHARED TASK: Identifying parallel sentences in comparable corpora



Website: https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2018/



********************************************************************



MOTIVATION



In the language engineering and the linguistics communities, research in

comparable corpora has been motivated by two main reasons. In language

engineering, on the one hand, it is chiefly motivated by the need to use 

comparable corpora as training data for statistical NLP applications such 

as statistical and neural machine translation or cross-lingual retrieval. 

In linguistics, on the other hand, comparable corpora are of interest in 

themselves by making possible cross-language discoveries and comparisons. 

It is generally accepted in both communities that comparable corpora are 

documents in one or several languages that are comparable in content and 

form in various degrees and dimensions. We believe that the linguistic 

definitions and observations related to comparable corpora can improve 

methods to mine such corpora for applications of statistical NLP. As such, 

it is of great interest to bring together builders and users of such corpora. 





TOPICS



Given that LREC takes place for the first time in Asia, this year's 

special theme is ""Comparable Corpora for Asian Languages"". But we 

solicit contributions also on all other topics related to comparable 

corpora, including but not limited to the following:

 

Building Comparable Corpora:



• Human translations

• Automatic and semi-automatic methods

• Methods to mine parallel and non-parallel corpora from the Web

• Tools and criteria to evaluate the comparability of corpora

• Parallel vs non-parallel corpora, monolingual corpora

• Rare and minority languages, across language families

• Multi-media/multi-modal comparable corpora



Applications of comparable corpora:



• Human translations

• Language learning

• Cross-language information retrieval & document categorization

• Bilingual projections

• Machine translation

• Writing assistance

• Machine learning techniques using comparable corpora



Mining from Comparable Corpora:



• Induction of morphological, grammatical, and translation rules from comparable corpora 

• Extraction of parallel segments or paraphrases from comparable corpora 

• Extraction of bilingual and multilingual translations of single words and multi-word expressions, proper names, and named entities from comparable corpora 

• Induction of multilingual word classes from comparable corpora

• Cross-language distributional semantics

SHARED TASK: Identifying parallel sentences in comparable corpora



As a continuation of the previous year's shared task, we announce a modified

shared task for 2018. As is well known, a bottleneck in statistical machine

translation is the scarceness of parallel resources for many language pairs

and domains. Previous research has shown that this bottleneck can be

reduced by utilizing parallel portions found within comparable corpora.

These are useful for many purposes, including automatic terminology

extraction and the training of statistical MT systems. The aim of the

shared task is to quantitatively evaluate competing methods for extracting

parallel sentences from comparable monolingual corpora, so as to give an

overview on the state of the art and to identify the best performing

approaches.



Any submission to the shared task is expected to be accompanied by a short 

paper (4 pages plus references). This will be accepted for publication in 

the workshop proceedings after a basic quality check: hence the submission 

will go via Softconf with the standard peer-review process.



SHARED TASK SCHEDULE



Shared task sample and training sets released: 22 December 2017

IDENTIFY, DESCRIBE AND SHARE YOUR LANGUAGE RESOURCES



Please make sure that your papers take into account the following information from the LREC-organizers about the LRE Map, the ""Share your LRs!"" initiative and the ISLRN number:



  * Describing your LRs in the LRE Map is now a normal practice in the

    submission procedure of LREC (introduced in 2010 and adopted by

    other conferences). To continue the efforts initiated at LREC 2014

    about “Sharing LRs” (data, tools, web-services, etc.), authors will

    have the possibility,  when submitting a paper, to upload LRs in a

    special LREC repository.  This effort of sharing LRs, linked to the

    LRE Map for their description, may become a new “regular” feature

    for conferences in our field, thus contributing to creating a common

    repository where everyone can deposit and share data.



  * As scientific work requires accurate citations of referenced work so

    as to allow the community to understand the whole context and also

    replicate the experiments conducted by other researchers, LREC 2018

    endorses the need to uniquely Identify LRs through the use of the

    International Standard Language Resource Number (ISLRN,

    www.islrn.org), a Persistent Unique Identifier to be assigned to

    each Language Resource. The assignment of ISLRNs to LRs cited in

    LREC papers  will be offered at submission time."

International Conference on Asian Language Processing 2014 (IALP2014)

20-22 October 2014, Kuching, Borneo Malaysia

http://ialp2014.colips.org/

Paper Submission Deadline is extended to 31 May 2014.

 

The International Conference on Asian Language Processing (IALP) is a series of conferences with unique focus on Asian Language Processing. The conference aims to advance the science and technology of all the aspects of Asian Language Processing by providing a forum for researchers in the different fields of language study all over the world to meet. The first meeting of the series was held in Singapore in 1986 and was called the ""International Conference on Chinese Computing (ICCC)"" then. This meeting initiated the study of Chinese and oriental languages processing in Singapore and resulted in the formation of COLIPS in Singapore in 1988, as well as the publication of the journal ""Communications of COLIPS"" in 1991, which is known as ""International Journal on Asian Language Processing"" today. Over the years, IALP has developed into one of important annual events on natural language processing in Asia.

 

This year, the International Conference on Asian Language Processing 2014 (IALP 2014) will be jointly organized by the Institute of Social Informatics and Technological Innovations (ISITI) and Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS), and Chinese and Oriental Languages Information Processing Society (COLIPS). The conference will be held at Hilton Kuching Hotel, Kuching, Sarawak, Borneo Malaysia on the 20-22 October, 2014. We will continue to work with IEEE to publish the conference proceedings, which will be submitted to the IEEE Xplore digital library and submitted for indexing in INSPEC, EI, ISTP/ISI and Current Contents on Diskette.

 

Kuching is the capital of Sarawak, the largest East Malaysian state, on the island of Borneo. In itself is a microcosm of cultures: 2.4 million people forming the 28 ethnic groups, each with its own culture and language. The city illuminates a mix of new and old architectures dating back to the White Rajahs. The local host of this conference, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS), is located 40 minute drive from Kuching. It is internationally recognised for providing indigenous technologies to communities in Borneo and beyond.

The United Institute of Informatics Problems (UIIP) of National Academy of Sciences of Belarus and Speech synthesis and recognition laboratory, and the ELLIADD laboratory from the Université de Franche-Comté, organize the NooJ 2015 International Conference in Minsk, June 11-13 2015.



NooJ is both a corpus processing tool and a linguistic development environment that allows linguists to formalize several levels of linguistic phenomena:



    typography and spelling;

    syllabification, phonemic and prosodic transcription;

    lexicons of simple words, multiword units and discontinuous expressions;

    inflectional, derivational and agglutinative morphology;

    local and structural syntax;

    transformational syntax and paraphrase generation;

    semantic analysis and machine translation.



NooJ provides linguists with regular grammars, context-free grammars, context-sensitive grammars, unrestricted grammars as well as their graphical equivalent (finite-state, recursive and contextual graphs) to facilitate the description of each phenomenon. NooJ’s multi-layer approach allows linguists to accumulate elementary descriptions and describe phenomena that cross linguistic levels. As a corpus processing tool, NooJ allows users to apply sophisticated linguistic queries to large corpora in real time, in order to construct indices and concordances, annotate texts automatically, perform semantic and statistical analyses, etc.



NooJ is open-source, freely available at www.nooj4nlp.net and over 20 linguistic modules can already be freely downloaded, as well as a manual, video tutorials, references, etc.  

The NooJ conference intends to:



    give NooJ users and researchers in Linguistics and in Computational Linguistics the opportunity to meet and share their experience as developers, researchers and teachers;

    present to NooJ users the latest linguistic resources and NLP applications developed for/with NooJ, its latest functionalities, as well as its future developments;

    offer researchers and graduate students two tutorials (one basic and one advanced) to help them parse corpora and build NLP applications using NooJ;

    provide the occasion to present and discover the recent developments of NooJ itself (v5).



TOPICS OF INTEREST



Linguistic resources: Typography, Spelling, Syllabification, Phonemic and Prosodic transcription, Morphology, Lexical Analysis, Local Syntax, Structural Syntax, Transformational Analysis, Paraphrase Generation, Semantic annotations, Semantic analysis.

Corpus processing: Corpus Linguistics, Information extraction, Discourse Analysis, Business Intelligence, NLP applications.

Last Call for Papers – deadline extended



The call for papers submission deadline has been extended to Monday 12 October, 12 a.m.



Call Deadline: 12-Oct-2015

 

Call for Papers:



We invite abstracts from all fields of linguistics which either:



a. Apply data from linguistic corpora, psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic experimentation, language acquisition, language pathology, fieldwork, historical texts or other sources to linguistic issues

b. Make use of quantifiable or replicable evidence to produce novel analyses or perspectives on questions of the representation, processing, or acquisition of linguistic systems

c. Offer insights into promising new methods of data collection, processing, and analysis which may be of interest to researchers in language.



We therefore particularly call for papers addressing these issues. The ideal paper will have both a data and a theoretical dimension.



Special session: Semantics and pragmatics interface phenomena - theory building and testing

The distinction between semantic and pragmatic components of meaning and the identification of their respective contributions towards sentence-level interpretation is a very active field of study in current linguistics.  As our understanding has advanced, it has become apparent that the two processes of meaning determination are linked in more complex ways than had been imagined, so that more sophisticated data is required in order to make advances. There is accordingly e.g. a lot of experimental research in this domain. 

One example of such semantics/pragmatics interface phenomena would be presuppositions and implicatures which are traditionally classified as semantic versus pragmatic, respectively. However, recent research challenges this traditional view, suggesting that boundaries are not as clear cut and that certain presuppositions might also be pragmatic (Simons, 2001; Abusch, 2010; Schlenker, 2008, 2009;Abrusan, 2011), whereas (scalar) implicatures might come about by inserting a semantic operator (Chierchia 2004, Chierchia, Fox & Spector 2011). Other phenomena of interest include speech acts and speech act level operators, variables and contextual variable assignments or restrictions, and indexicality.

For this special session we invite contributions which address questions relating to such semantic and pragmatic interface phenomena using empirical methods. The ideal paper will relate empirical results back to linguistic theory and include an analysis that impacts our understanding of the semantics/pragmatics interface.

The event will be held online, face-to-face or hybrid, depending on the health situation. The proceedings will be published preemptively, in December 2021.



Depling is a bi-annual conference dedicated to dependency-based approaches in linguistics and natural language processing. Dependencies, directed labeled graph structures representing hierarchical relations between morphemes, words or semantic units, have now become the standard representation of syntactic resources and NLP technologies. Depling has become the central event for people discussing the linguistic significance of these structures, their theoretical and formal foundations, their processing, and their use in NLP tools. 



Selected topics of interest

----------------------------

For this edition, we would like to put a special emphasis on two topics of interest:

- the epistemological and historical foundations of dependency linguistics (how dependency is defined, how it emerged, how it was formalized, etc.);

- relations between theoretical dependency linguistics and NLP tasks (how, e.g., syntactic models are framed to achieve specific tasks, how the results of such computational tasks modify our conceptions about linguistic modeling, etc.).



Other topics are of course welcome. Topics include but are not limited to:

* The use of dependency structures in theoretical linguistics; a.o.: 

  - The use of syntactic trees to model syntactic relations;

  - The use of semantic, valency-based or predicate-argument graph structures;

  - The use of dependency-like structures to model semantic and pragmatic phenomena related to information structure;

  - The use of dependency-like structures beyond the sentence (e.g., to model discourse phenomena);

  - The elaboration of formal lexicons for dependency-based syntax and semantics, including descriptions of collocations and paradigmatic relations;

  - The use of dependency in the field of linguistic universals, and typology.

* Historical and epistemological foundations of dependency grammar:

  - The definition of the very notion of dependency;

  - The development and the use of dependency-based diagrams;

  - Dependency grammar and its relation to other formalisms;

  - The use of dependency-like concepts in the history of grammar and linguistics.

* The use of the dependency structures in corpus linguistics:

  - Corpus annotation and development of dependency-based treebanks and other linguistic resources of written and spoken texts;

  - Recent advances in dependency-based parsing, and text generation;

  - Cross-lingual dependency parser evaluation, with particular emphasis on intrinsic evaluation metrics.

* The relation between dependency-based grammar and other fields of science, such as, e.g., the psycholinguistic relevance of dependency grammar.



Paper submission information

----------------------------

Papers should describe original work related to dependency-based linguistics. They should emphasize completed work rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance and relevance to the conference, and interest to the attendees. All the details for submission can be found on the conference page.

CONFERENCE AIMS

LREC is the major event on Language Resources (LRs) and Evaluation for Human Language Technologies (HLT). LREC aims to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art, explore new R&D directions and emerging trends, exchange information regarding LRs and their applications, evaluation methodologies and tools, on-going and planned activities, industrial uses and needs, requirements coming from e-science and e-society, with respect both to policy issues and to scientific/technological and organisational ones.



LREC provides a unique forum for researchers, industrials and funding agencies from across a wide spectrum of areas to discuss problems and opportunities, find new synergies and promote initiatives for international cooperation, in support of investigations in language sciences, progress in language technologies (LT) and development of corresponding products, services and applications, and standards.



CONFERENCE TOPICS

LREC 2014 HOT TOPICS



Big Data, Linked Open Data, LRs and HLT



The ever-increasing quantities of large and complex digital datasets, structured or unstructured, multilingual, multimodal or multimedia, pose new challenges but at the same time open up new opportunities for HLT and related fields. Ubiquitous data and information capturing devices, social media and networks, the web at large with its big data / knowledge bases and other information capturing / aggregating / publishing platforms are providing useful information and/or knowledge for a wide range of LT applications.  

LREC 2014 puts a strong emphasis on the synergies of the big Linked Open Data and LRs/LT communities and their complementarity in cracking LT problems and developing useful applications and services.



LRs in the Collaborative Age



The amount of collaboratively generated and used language data is constantly increasing and it is therefore time to open a wide discussion on such LRs at LREC. There is a need to discuss the types of LRs that can be collaboratively generated and used.

Are lexicons, dictionaries, corpora, ontologies (of language data), grammars, tagsets, data categories, all possible fields in which a collaborative approach can be applied? Can collaboratively generated LRs be standardised/harmonised? And how can quality control be applied to collaboratively generated LRs? How can a collaborative approach ensure that less-resourced languages receive the same digital dignity as mainstream languages?

There is also a need to discuss legal aspects related to collaboratively generated LRs. And last but not least: are there different types of collaborative approaches, or is the Wikimedia style the best approach to collaborative generation and use of LRs?



LREC 2014 SPECIAL HIGHLIGHT



Share your LRs!



In addition to describing your LRs in the LRE Map – now a normal step in the submission procedure of many conferences – LREC 2014 recognises that the time is ripe to launch another important initiative, the LREC Repository of shared LRs!

When submitting a paper, you will be offered the possibility to share your LRs (data, tools, web-services, etc.), uploading them in a special LREC META-SHARE repository set up by ELRA.

Your LRs will be made available to all LREC participants before the conference, to be re-used, compared, analysed, …

This effort of sharing LRs, linked to the LRE Map for their description, may become a new ""regular"" feature for conferences in our field, thus contributing to creating a common repository where everyone can deposit and share data.



PROGRAMME

The Scientific Programme will include invited talks, oral presentations, poster and demo presentations, and panels, in addition to a keynote address by the winner of the Antonio Zampolli Prize.



SUBMISSIONS AND DATES

Submission of proposals for oral and poster (or poster+demo) papers: 15 October 2013

Abstracts should consist of about 1500-2000 words, will be submitted through START and will be peer-reviewed.



Submission of proposals for panels, workshops and tutorials: 15 October 2013

Proposals should be submitted via an online form on the LREC website and will be reviewed by the Programme Committee.



PROCEEDINGS

The Proceedings will include both oral and poster papers, in the same format.



There is no difference in quality between oral and poster presentations. Only the appropriateness of the type of communication (more or less interactive) to the content of the paper will be considered.



In addition a Book of Abstracts will be printed.

Constraint Solving and Language Processing - CSLP 2012 - 

Seventh International Workshop

University of Orléans, Orléans, France

September 13-14, 2012

http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/evenements/CSLP2012/





INTRODUCTION



The Constraint Solving and Language Processing (CSLP) workshop

considers the role of constraints in the representation of language

and the implementation of language processing from an

interdisciplinary perspective. This theme should be interpreted

inclusively: contributions from linguistics, computer science,

psycholinguistics and related areas are welcome, and an

interdisciplinary perspective is of particular interest.



Constraints are widely used in linguistics, computer science, and

psychology. How they are used, however, varies widely according to the

research domain: knowledge representation, cognitive modelling,

problem solving mechanisms, etc. These different perspectives are

complementary, each one adding a piece to the puzzle. For example,

linguistics proposes in-depth descriptions implementing constraints in

order to filter out structures by means of description languages,

constraint ranking, etc. The constraint programming paradigm, on the

other hand, shows that constraints have to be taken as a systematic

whole and can thus play a role in building the structures (or can even

replace structures). Finally, psycholinguistics experiment have been

made, investigating the role of constraint systems for cognitive

processes in comprehension and production, as well as addressing how

they can be acquired.





TOPICS



CSLP is open to submissions on topics including, but not limited to:



 * Constraints in human language comprehension and production

 * Context modelling and discourse interpretation

 * Acquisition of constraints

 * Constraints and learning

 * Cross-theoretical view of the notion of constraint

 * New advances in constraint-based linguistic theories

 * Constraint satisfaction (CS) technologies for NLP

 * Linguistic analysis and linguistic theories biased towards CS or

   constraint logic programming (CLP)  

 * Application of CS or CLP for NLP

 * CS and CLP for other than textual or spoken languages, e.g., sign

   languages and biological, multimodal human-computer interaction,

   visual languages

 * Probabilistic constraint-based reasoning for NLP and context

   comprehension 





PREVIOUS EDITIONS



Six CSLP workshops have been organized in the past in: Karlsruhe,

Germany (2011), Hamburg, Germany (2008), Roskilde, Denmark (2007),

Sydney, Australia (2006), Sitges, Spain (2005), Roskilde, Denmark

(2004).

Workshop description

--------------------------------

Nowadays, computational ontologies are commonly used as conceptual

models of information systems (IS) created in different domains, such

as: engineering, law, social sciences, biomedicine, humanities, business

enterprise, geography, library science etc. They are used both in the

design and the exploitation phases of the IS's life. However, what can

be largely observed, the main drawback of the majority of such

ontologies is their insufficient ontic expressiveness and lack of a good

foundations. Thus, the question arises: is the ontological engineering

mature enough to apply the sophisticated theoretical solutions and

propose methodologies and tools enabling to create both practical and

expressive ontologies for everyday use? We call such ontologies shortly:

""well-founded"".



The aim of the workshop is to gather researchers and practitioners

interested in answering the posed question. Particularly, we single out

three main scientific areas, for which research feedback is expected.



The first domain of interest addresses the design and application of

ontological structures that are strongly influenced by philosophy, but

are still reasonably applicable. The area includes foundational approach

driven ontology creation strategies for concrete domains and applications.



The linguistic investigations concerning national and multi-language

semantic lexicons provide, among other resources, also the top-level

ontologies. The second considered research area addresses the problem of

using such ontologies (possibly accompanied by other linguistic

resources) to build well-founded and tractable domain conceptual models.



Most ontology-building approaches proposed by computer engineers employ

algorithimcs (i.e. data mining, machine learning etc.). Even though they

benefit from the automation at the same time they suffer from the bad

(ontic) quality of obtained ontologies. Thus, issues concerned with

bridging the gap between bottom-up automatically engineered ontologies

and foundational/top-level manually created ones, constitute the third

scientific area we are strongly interested in.

The sixth international conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC) will be organised in 2008

by ELRA in cooperation with a wide range of international associations and organisations.

CONFERENCE AIMS

In 10 years �?? the first LREC was held in Granada in 1998 �?? LREC has become the major event on Language

Resources (LRs) and Evaluation for Human Language Technologies (HLT). The aim of LREC is to provide

an overview of the state-of-the-art, explore new R&D directions and emerging trends, exchange information

regarding LRs and their applications, evaluation methodologies and tools, ongoing and planned activities,

industrial uses and needs, requirements coming from the e-society, both with respect to policy issues and to

technological and organisational ones.

LREC provides a unique forum for researchers, industrials and funding agencies from across a wide

spectrum of areas to discuss problems and opportunities, find new synergies and promote initiatives for

international cooperation, in support to investigations in language sciences, progress in language technologies

and development of corresponding products, services and applications, and standards.

                 CONFERENCE TOPICS

Issues in the design, construction and use of Language Resources (LRs): text, speech, multimodality

     �?�Guidelines, standards, specifications, models and best practices for LRs

     �?�Methodologies and tools for LRs construction and annotation

     �?�Methodologies and tools for the extraction and acquisition of knowledge

     �?�Ontologies and knowledge representation

     �?�Terminology

     �?�Integration between (multilingual) LRs, ontologies and Semantic Web technologies

     �?�Metadata descriptions of LRs and metadata for semantic/content markup

Exploitation of LRs in different types of systems and applications

     �?� For: information extraction, information retrieval, speech dictation, mobile communication, machine

          translation, summarisation, web services, semantic search, text mining, inferencing, reasoning, etc.

     �?� In different types of interfaces: (speech-based) dialogue systems, natural language and

          multimodal/multisensorial interactions, voice activated services, etc.

     �?�Communication with neighbouring fields of applications, e.g. e-government, e-culture, e-health, e-

     participation, mobile applications, etc.

     �?�Industrial LRs requirements, user needs

Issues in Human Language Technologies evaluation

     �?�HLT Evaluation methodologies, protocols and measures

     �?�Validation, quality assurance, evaluation of LRs

     �?�Benchmarking of systems and products

     �?�Usability evaluation of HLT-based user interfaces, interactions and dialog systems

General issues regarding LRs & Evaluation

     �?�National and international activities and projects

     �?�Priorities, perspectives, strategies in national and international policies for LRs

     �?�Open architectures

     �?�Organisational, economical and legal issues

                 Special Highlights

LREC targets the integration of different types of LRs �?? spoken, written, and other modalities �?? and of the

respective communities. To this end, LREC encourages submissions covering issues which are common to

different types of LRs and language technologies.

LRs are currently developed and deployed in a much wider range of applications and domains. LREC 2008

recognises the need to encompass all those data that interact with language resources in an attempt to model

more complex human processes and develop more complex systems, and encourages submissions on topics

such as:

     �?�Multimodal and multimedia systems, for Human-Machine interfaces, Human-Human interactions,

     and content processing

     �?�Resources for modelling language-related cognitive processes, including emotions

     �?�Interaction/Association of language and perception data, also for robotic systems

PROGRAMME

The Scientific Programme will include invited talks, oral presentations, poster and demo presentations, and

panels.

There is no difference in quality between oral and poster presentations. Only the appropriateness of the

type of communication (more or less interactive) to the content of the paper will be considered.

SUBMISSIONS AND DATES

Submitted abstracts of papers for oral and poster or demo presentations should consist of about 1500-2000

words.

     �?�Submission of proposals for oral and poster/demo papers: 31 October 2007

Proposals for panels, workshops and tutorials will be reviewed by the Programme Committee.

     �?�Submission of proposals for panels, workshops and tutorials: 31 October 2007

              4-6 August 2013. Workshop in Hamburg.





Workshop Aims



Narratives are ubiquitous in human experience. We use them to

communicate, convince, explain, and entertain. As far as we know, every

society in the world has narratives, which suggests they are rooted in

our psychology and serve an important cognitive function. It is becoming

increasingly clear that, to truly understand and explain human

intelligence, beliefs, and behaviors, we will have to understand why and

to what extent narrative is universal and explain (or explain away) the

function it serves. The aim of this workshop series is to address key

questions that advance our understanding of narrative and our ability to

model it computationally.





Special Focus: Cognitive Science



This workshop will be an appropriate venue for papers addressing

fundamental topics and questions regarding narrative. The workshop will

be held as a satellite event of the 2013 Annual Meeting of the Cognitive

Science Society (to be held in Berlin 31st July - 3rd August), and will

have a special focus on the cognitive science of narrative. Although the

workshop hosts papers that treat issues fundamental to the computational

modeling and scientific understanding of narrative, this year we have a

focus on narrative's cognitive, linguistic, or philosophical aspects.

Both finished research and more tentative exploratory work will be

presented.





Proceedings



Papers will be published in an electronic proceedings volume in the

series OASIcs (Open Access Series in Informatics, Schloss Dagstuhl).





Prizes



The prize for the best student paper will be awarded to Graham Sack for

his paper ""Character Networks for Narrative Generation: Structural

Balance Theory and the Emergence of Proto-Narratives"". The prize for the

best student paper on a cognitive science topic will be awarded to

Angela Nyhout for her paper ""Constructing spatial representations from

narratives and non-narrative descriptions: Evidence from 7-year-olds"".

Over the course of the past decade, a revolution has occurred in the materials available for the study of folklore. The scope of digital archives of traditional expressive forms has exploded, and the magnitude of machine-readable materials available for consideration has increased by many orders of magnitude. Many national archives have made significant efforts to make their archival resources machine-readable, while other smaller initiatives have focused on the digitization of archival resources related to smaller regions, a single collector, or a single genre. Simultaneously, the explosive growth in social media, web logs (blogs), and other Internet resources have made previously hard to access forms of traditional expressive culture accessible at a scale so large that it is hard to fathom. These developments, coupled to the development of algorithmic approaches to the analysis of large, unstructured data and new methods for the visualization of the relationships discovered by these algorithmic approaches - from mapping to 3-D embedding, from time-lines to navigable visualizations - offer folklorists new opportunities for the analysis of traditional expressive forms. We label approaches to the study of folklore that leverage the power of these algorithmic approaches ""Computational Folkloristics"" (Abello, Broadwell, Tangherlini 2012).



The Journal of American Folklore invites papers for consideration for inclusion in a special issue of the journal edited by Timothy Tangherlini that focuses on ""Computational Folkloristics."" The goal of the special issue is to reveal how computational methods can augment the study of folklore, and propose methods that can extend the traditional reach of the discipline. To avoid confusion, we term those approaches ""computational"" that make use of algorithmic methods to assist in the interpretation of relationships or structures in the underlying data. Consequently, ""Computational Folkloristics"" is distinct from Digital Folklore in the application of computation to a digital representation of a corpus.



We are particularly interested in papers that focus on: the automatic discovery of narrative structure; challenges in Natural Language Processing (NLP) related to unlabeled, multilingual data including named entity detection and resolution; topic modeling and other methods that explore latent semantic aspects of a folklore corpus; the alignment of folklore data with external historical datasets such as census records; GIS applications and methods; network analysis methods for the study of, among other things, propagation, community detection and influence; rapid classification of unlabeled folklore data; search and discovery on and across folklore corpora; modeling of folklore processes; automatic labeling of performance phenomena in visual data; automatic classification of audio performances. Other novel approaches to the study of folklore that make use of algorithmic approaches will also be considered.



A significant challenge of this special issue is to address these issues in a manner that is directly relevant to the community of folklorists (as opposed to computer scientists). Articles should be written in such a way that the argument and methods are accessible and understandable for an audience expert in folklore but not expert in computer science or applied mathematics. To that end, we encourage team submissions that bridge the gap between these disciplines. If you are in doubt about whether your approach or your target domain is appropriate for consideration in this special issue, please email the issue editor, Timothy Tangherlini at tango@humnet.ucla.edu, using the subject line ""Computational Folkloristics query"". Deadline for all queries is April 1, 2013.



All papers must conform to the Journal of American Folklore's style sheet for authors. The guidelines for article submission are as follows: Essay manuscripts should be no more than 10,000 words in length, including abstract, notes, and bibliography. The article must begin with a 50- to 75-word abstract that summarizes the essential points and findings of the article. Whenever possible, authors should submit two copies of their manuscripts by email attachment to the editor of the special issue at: tango@humnet.ucla.edu. The first copy should be sent in Microsoft Word or Rich Text Format (rtf) and should include the author's name. Figures should not be included in this document, but 'call outs' should be used to designate where figures should be placed (e.g., (insert Figure 1 here)). A list at the end of the article (placed after the bibliography) should detail the figures to be included, along with their captions. The second copy of the manuscript should be sent in Portable Document Format (pdf). This version should not include the author's name or any references within the text that would identify the author to the manuscript reviewers. Passages that would identify the author can be marked in the following manner to indicate excised words: (****). Figures should be embedded in this version just as they would ideally be placed in the published text. Possible supplementary materials (e.g., additional photographs, sound files, video footage, etc.) that might accompany the article in its online version should be described in a cover letter addressed to the editor.  An advisory board for the special issue consisting of folklorists and computer scientists will initially consider all papers. Once accepted for the special issue, all articles will be subject to the standard refereeing procedure for the journal. Deadline for submissions for consideration is June 15, 2013. Initial decisions will be made by August 1, 2013. Final decisions will be made by October 1, 2013. We expect the issue to appear in 2014."

AREAS OF INTEREST

The conference is on grammatical inference. Key interests are

machine-learning methods applied to discrete combinatorial structures

such as strings, trees, or graphs, and algorithms for learning

symbolic models such as grammars, automata, Markov models, or pattern

languages. The conference seeks to provide a forum for presentation

and discussion of original research papers on all aspects of

grammatical inference including, but not limited to: 

- Theoretical aspects of grammatical inference: learning paradigms,

  learnability results, complexity of learning. 

- Theoretical and experimental analysis of different grammatical

  inference approaches, including artificial neural networks,

  statistical methods, symbolic methods, information-theoretic

  approaches, minimum description length, complexity-theoretic

  approaches, heuristic methods, etc. 

- Algorithms and frameworks for learning models representing language

  classes inside and outside the Chomsky hierarchy, including tree and

  graph grammars.

- Learning models with additional, sometimes numeric, inputs/outputs

  such as transducers, register automata, timed automata, and

  semi-hidden Markov models.

- Active learning of these and other languages.

- Methods for estimating probability distributions over strings,

  trees, graphs, or any data used as input for symbolic models.

- Combinations of grammatical inference with related fields such as

  semantic representations, formal methods, or multi-agent systems.

- Novel approaches to grammatical inference: induction by DNA

  computing or quantum computing, evolutionary approaches, spectral

  algorithms, using combinatorial solvers, new representation spaces,

  etc. 

- Successful applications of grammatical inference to tasks such as

  natural language processing, unsupervised parsing, bioinformatics,

  web interface design, robot navigation, machine translation, pattern

  recognition, language acquisition, software engineering,

  computational linguistics, spam and malware detection, cognitive

  psychology, etc. 



AUTHOR GUIDELINES

We invite three types of papers: 

- Formal and/or technical papers describe original solutions

  (theoretical, methodological or conceptual) in the field of

  grammatical inference. A technical paper should clearly describe the

  situation or problem tackled, the relevant state of the art, the

  position or solution suggested and the benefits of the contribution. 

- Exploratory papers can describe completely new research positions or

  approaches. Open problems may be suggested. Current limits can be

  discussed. In all cases rigor in presentation will be required. Such

  papers must describe precisely the situation, problem, or challenge

  addressed, and demonstrate how current methods, tools, ways of

  reasoning, may be inadequate. The authors must rigorously present

  their approach and demonstrate its pertinence and correctness to

  addressing the identified situation. 

- Tool papers describing a new tool for grammatical inference. The

  tool must be publicly available and the paper has to contain several

  use-case studies describing the use of the tool. In addition, the

  paper should clearly describe the implemented algorithms, input

  parameters and syntax, and the produced output.

There are no restrictions on the domain of application as long as the

paper provides sufficient background information. 



CONFERENCE FORMAT

The conference will include plenary and invited talks, tool

demonstrations, and poster presentations of accepted papers. 



SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Prospective authors are invited to submit a draft paper that

represents original and previously unpublished work. Simultaneous

submission to other conferences with published proceedings is not

allowed. 



All papers should be submitted electronically by 12 June, 2016 AOE; the

submission URL is: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icgi2016.



Each paper should contain title, authors and affiliation, mailing

address, a brief abstract describing the work and at least three

keywords that describe the contents of the work.



Papers must be submitted in pdf format. The total length of the paper

should not exceed 12 pages on A4-size paper. The use of LaTeX is

strongly encouraged. Prospective authors are strongly recommended to

use the JMLR style file for LaTeX available here:

http://www.jmlr.org/format/format.html.

Posters will be presented by the organizers during the LTC in the conference area. No extra fee will be charged for this form of presentation. The poster size will be A1, horizontal.



(Notice. The Poster forum should not be confused with traditional poster sessions. In particular, there will be no limited resentation time and the posters do not have to be accompanied by the authors)



*Hyde park corner*

We intend to arrange ""A Hyde Park Corner"" for non-reviewed presentations and positions. Limited number of presentations (depending on the available space) will be accepted. The content must meet the conference scope and aims. Both form and content must conform to the Polish and International Law. Texts will be presented on the sole responsibility of the authors/presenters and will not be published or reproduced in the Conference documents.

 

*A book exhibition* is intended (exhibitor may address their proposals by e-mail at ltc@amu.edu.pl). Also, registered participants are invited to bring hard copies of their papers and books. We plan to make special presentations of the achievements of the conference participants, irrespective of whether they are directly related to the conference topic.



*Tutorials* A tutorial program is under construction.



*Special events.* Besides the standard conference presentation of papers, the Organizers are open to various kinds of initiatives (expos, demos, satellite workshops, panels, awards).  A program of special events is now under construction. You are welcome to contact us with your suggestions.



AWARDS FOR BEST STUDENT PAPERS

As at the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Language and Technology Conferences (2005, 2007, 2009) special awards will be granted to the best student papers.

NooJ is both a corpus processing tool and a linguistic development environment that allows linguists to formalize several levels of linguistic phenomena:



    typography and spelling;

    syllabification, phonemic and prosodic transcription;

    lexicons of simple words, multiword units and discontinuous expressions;

    inflectional, derivational and agglutinative morphology;

    local and structural syntax;

    transformational syntax and paraphrase generation;

    semantic analysis and machine translation.



NooJ provides linguists with regular grammars, context-free grammars, context-sensitive grammars, unrestricted grammars as well as their graphical equivalent (finite-state, recursive and contextual graphs) to facilitate the description of each phenomenon. NooJ’s multi-layer approach allows linguists to accumulate elementary descriptions and describe phenomena that cross linguistic levels. As a corpus processing tool, NooJ allows users to apply sophisticated linguistic queries to large corpora in real time, in order to construct indices and concordances, annotate texts automatically, perform semantic and statistical analyses, etc.



NooJ is open-source, freely available at www.nooj4nlp.net and over 20 linguistic modules can already be freely downloaded, as well as a manual, video tutorials, references, etc.  



The NooJ conference intends to:



    give NooJ users and researchers in Linguistics and in Computational Linguistics the opportunity to meet and share their experience as developers, researchers and teachers;

    present to NooJ users the latest linguistic resources and NLP applications developed for/with NooJ, its latest functionalities, as well as its future developments;

    offer researchers and graduate students two tutorials (one basic and one advanced) to help them parse corpora and build NLP applications using NooJ;

    provide the occasion to present and discover the recent developments of NooJ itself (v5).



TOPICS OF INTEREST



Linguistic resources: Typography, Spelling, Morphology, Lexical Analysis, Local Syntax, Structural Syntax, Transformational Analysis, Paraphrase Generation, Semantic annotations, Semantic analysis.

Corpus processing: Corpus Linguistics, Information extraction, Discourse Analysis, Business Intelligence, NLP applications."

The 4th Computational Linguistics Scientific Summarization Shared Task, 

CL-SciSumm-18 @ SIGIR 2018: http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cl-scisumm2018/



You are invited to participate in the CL-SciSumm 2018 Shared Task, 

as part of the 3rd Joint Workshop of Bibliometric-enhanced IR and NLP 

for Digital Libraries (BIRNDL) at SIGIR 2018 on Thursday, July 12,  2018.



The 4th CL-SciSumm Shared Task on scientific paper summarization 

follows up on and extends the corpus sizes of the successful Shared Tasks 

conducted as a part of the BIRNDL workshops in 2017, 2016 and 

the Pilot Task conducted as a part of the BiomedSumm Track at the 



Text Analysis Conference 2014. In the CL-SciSumm 2017 Shared Task, 

fifteen teams from six countries signed up, and ten teams ultimately submitted 

and presented their results. The task is run on CL-Scisumm corpus, the largest 

annotated corpus for scientific summarization, comprising over 500 

computational linguistics (CL) research papers, interlinked through a citation 

network. The corpus is available for free download and use 

at https://github.com/WING-NUS/scisumm-corpus. The repository also 

archives all results from all prior runs of the Shared Task.



The Shared Task comprises three sub-tasks in automatic research 

paper summarization on a new corpus of research papers. This task 

is expected to be of interest to a broad community including those 

working in CL and NLP, especially in the sub-disciplines of text 

summarization, natural language generation, text reuse, discourse 

structure in scholarly discourse, paraphrase, textual entailment 

and text simplification.



=== The Task ===



Given: A topic consisting of a Reference Paper (RP) and ten or more



Citing Papers (CPs) that all contain citations to the RP. In each CP,

the text spans (i.e., citances) have been identified that pertain to a

particular citation to the RP.



Task 1a: For each citance, identify the spans of text (cited text

spans) in the RP that most accurately reflect the citance. These are

of the granularity of a sentence fragment, a full sentence, or several

consecutive sentences (no more than 5).



Task 1b: For each cited text span, identify what facet of the paper it

belongs to, from a predefined set of facets.



Evaluation: Task 1 will be scored by overlap of text spans in the

system output vs the gold standard created by human annotators



Task 2: (optional bonus task): Finally, generate a structured summary 

of the RP from the cited text spans of the RP. The length of the summary 

should not exceed 250 words.



Evaluation: Task 2 will be scored using the ROUGE evaluation metric 

to compare automatic summaries against paper abstracts, human 

written summaries and community summaries constructed using 

the output of Task 1a.



=== Important Dates ===



March 19: Training set posted

April 8: Deadline for expression of interest and short system

descriptions due



May 1: Test set posted

May 20: System runs from the test set due

May 27: System reports (paper) due

June 25: Camera ready contributions due

July 12, 2018: Participants present at the BIRNDL 2018 workshop in Ann Arbor, MI, USA



=== The Corpus ===



The CL-SciSumm corpus is created by randomly sampling documents from

the ACL Anthology corpus and selecting their citing papers. Citing paper may 

Include papers from outside the Anthology. For

CL-SciSumm 2018, we have selected three portions of this source

collection to be annotated and serve as training, development and test

collections. The training set of articles is available for download

at GitHub (https://github.com/WING-NUS/scisumm-corpus) and can be used

by participants to pilot their systems.  Watch for updates to the

GitHub repository, as we will be updating the repository with announcements 

and new files. The system outputs from the test set should be submitted to 

the task organizers, for the collation of the final results to be presented at 

the workshop.



=== Registration ===



Organizations wishing to participate in the CL Shared Task track at



BIRNDL 2018 are invited to register on EasyChair:

(https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=birndl2018) by April 8th with 

a tentative abstract. Please prefix “CLSciSumm Shared Task: ” to the 

title of your submission. Participants are advised to register as soon as 

possible in order to receive timely access to evaluation resources, 

including training development and testing data. Registration for the

task does not commit you to participation - but is helpful to know for 

planning. All participants who submit system runs are welcome to 

present their systems as posters/selected presentations at the 

BIRNDL 2018 Workshop at Ann Arbor, MI, USA.



Dissemination of CL-SciSumm work and results other than in the

workshop proceedings is welcomed, but the conditions of participation

specifically preclude any advertising claims based on these results.

Any questions about conference participation may be sent to the

organizers mentioned below.

The gist of the event is, namely, to present your personal research topic in a short, simple, concentrated from, while keeping it accessible to the interdisciplinary audience of the conference, thus enabling feedback from different angles and fields, both academic and industrial. As such, there are no restrictions on the topic, as long as it is related to research on (or applications of) human language. As with the main conference, we naturally welcome linguists, but also researchers from other fields like language psychology, communication studies, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, etc. We also very much encourage young researchers about to complete a degree to participate in the workshop (for example: why not get feedback on your soon to be defended master's thesis?). 



Traditionally, Pecha Kucha  (ペチャクチャ) is a short presentation format where the talk is accompanied by 20 slides, 20 seconds allocated for each slide. As such, talks are 6 minutes and 40 seconds in length. To save time, the slides are often set to change automatically after every 20 seconds mark. While we expect you to adhere to the time constraint (7 minutes tops for talks, followed by 3 minutes for short questions), it will be entirely up to you if you choose to follow the 20-20 format exactly and automatize the slideshow (the functionality exists in various presentation software), or to change your slides manually. Given the shorter and more concentrated nature of the presentations, the abstracts are expected to be similarly brief. An abstract for the Language Science Pecha Kucha should be formatted as follows:



Filename: PK_Firstname_Lastname_shortened_title.txt 

[please submit your abstract as a plain text file]



Title of the Presentation

Name of the Author(s)

Affiliation(s) (university, company, etc.)



The abstract should consist of a single paragraph, no longer than 7 sentences. Summarize the topic of the research you are presenting, give a brief overview of the theory or previous research. Present your findings and their implications. You may also touch upon the questions posed in the call for papers of the Why Linguistics Conference, but this is completely optional. Please use the UTF-8 encoding.



References (if any; no more than 3)



The abstract submission deadline for the Pecha Kucha workshop is the 12th of April. Acceptance of the presentation will be communicated to the authors within a week from that at most. Please submit your abstract by sending it to the conference email address (whylinguistics [[at]] gmail.com). On the subject line, please write ""Pecha Kucha Abstract"" (without the quotes)."

				   RELATIONS 

			Workshop on meaning relations 

			between phrases and sentences



Website

https://sites.google.com/view/relations-2019



Description

The RELATIONS workshop invites submissions of long and short papers

on substantial, original, and unpublished research focusing on

comparing the meaning of linguistic expressions such as phrases,

clauses, sentences, and paragraphs. We are interested in both:

theoretical research on the nature of meaning relations and the

empirical work on identifying, generating, and extracting them. We

also invite submissions studying the impact of the relations in

downstream applications.





Topics

Examples for meaning relations of interest are:

Synonymy/Paraphrase (Phrases/sentences having approx. the same

meaning)

Entailment (One phrase/sentence being inferred from another)

Specificity (One phrase/sentence being more general than another)

Similarity (Phrases/sentences with a partial meaning overlap) 



Topics of interest wrt. meaning relations include, but are not

limited to:

Annotating meaning relations

Resources for meaning relations

Applications making use of meaning relations

Transfer Learning between meaning relations

Evaluation frameworks or metrics for meaning relations

Meaning representation models and their connection with meaning

relations (symbolic as well as statistical approaches)

Theoretical research on the nature of the meaning relations e.g. a

typology, or a comparison of several relations



Important Dates

Submission deadline (tentative): March 07

Author notification: April 07

Camera ready: April 20

Workshop: May 23

Note: All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (""anywhere on Earth"")



Submission and Reviewing

Papers should be submitted electronically via EasyChair. The

submission site will be announced shortly.  Each paper will be

reviewed by at least two members of the Program Committee.  Accepted

papers are expected to be presented at the workshop and will be

published in the workshop proceedings.

Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore, the paper must

not include the authors' names and affiliations or self-references

that reveal the authors’ identity--e.g., ""We previously showed

(Smith, 1991) ..."" should be replaced with citations such as ""Smith

(1991) previously showed ..."". Papers that do not conform to these

requirements will be rejected without review.



Dual Submission Policy

Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or

publications must indicate this at submission time. Authors of papers

accepted for presentation at RELATIONS 2019 must notify the program

chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper will be

presented. All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to

appear in the proceedings. We will not accept for publication or

presentation papers that overlap significantly in content or results

with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere.

All submissions should comply with the recent ACL policies on

Submission, Review and Citation. The authors are strongly encouraged

to check those here before submitting their paper.

TALN Workshop 2014
 


Organizers: Mathieu Mangeot and Fatiha Sadat
 


Presentation
 


Following the first TALAf workshop held on June 8, 2012 in Grenoble, during the JEP-TALN- conference RECITAL 2012, we are offering a new edition of this workshop during the TALN 2014 conference on July 1 in Marseille.



The aim of the TALAf workshop is to carry out an inventory of the work of constitution of basic linguistic resources (dictionaries, oral and written corpuses), to develop simple and economical methodologies of resource development, to exchange on techniques to dispense with certain non-existent resources and to set a certain number of principles for future work in the field. We welcome the work carried out on all poorly endowed languages ​​in Africa. North African dialect Arabic (Maghrebian) is also welcome.



Research into automatic processing of African languages ​​is currently on the verge of major developments. The efforts to recognize national languages ​​and standardize the different alphabets are starting to bear fruit. In Niger, for example, the alphabets of the Fulfulde, Hausa, Kanouri, Songhai-Zarma and Tamajaq languages ​​were defined by government decrees in 1999. In addition, a number of colleagues trained in northern countries are returning to their countries. with the desire to continue their work on local languages. There are also diasporas with technological means enabling them to contribute directly online and on a voluntary basis.



However, the national languages ​​of most African countries are poorly endowed (π-languages): available electronic resources are scarce, poorly distributed, or even non-existent. Only the editing and printing functions are accessible, making it difficult to use these languages. When it comes to introducing them into the education system, creating standardized and stabilized writing standards and above all developing their written and oral use in administration and daily life, a development of these languages ​​is essential.



Developing automatic processing of African languages ​​requires the development of resources which will be the foundations from which more elaborate processing can be built. It appears essential to constitute in the first place written and oral corpus annotated as large as possible. From such corpora, it is possible to extract examples to help build dictionaries or to develop language models for speech recognition. However, the constitution of such corpora remains a delicate undertaking in the context of poorly endowed languages ​​because the transcriptions suffer from the lack of standardization of the language and the enrichment of corpora remains very expensive.



The development of oral processing-based applications can be considered a priority in regions with an oral tradition. In addition, the widespread use of mobile phones makes it possible to imagine a rapid deployment of these applications.



Dictionaries are also needed to build basic tools such as spell checkers (which in turn can be used to correct written corpora) or even to help transcribe oral corpora. There are sometimes bilingual dictionaries combining the official language and a national language. For example, in Mali, Father Charles Bailleul is the author of a Bambara-French dictionary; in Niger, the SOUTÉBA educational project created five bilingual dictionaries intended for primary school children. But these only exist in paper version or as text editor files (format.doc). Computerizing these dictionaries to make them usable by automatic processing tools requires, first of all, adding missing information: pronunciation, morphological and inflectional inflection rules, examples and translations taken from corpora, etc. The first step is to computerize them (transform them into a format that can be used by automatic processing tools) and complete them with missing information: pronunciation, examples and translations taken from corpora, etc. Tricks can sometimes be invented to compensate for the lack of resources. For example, if there is no oral corpus with transcriptions, it is possible to constitute an oral corpus of read texts. examples and translations taken from corpora, etc. Tricks can sometimes be invented to compensate for the lack of resources. For example, if there is no oral corpus with transcriptions, it is possible to constitute an oral corpus of read texts. examples and translations taken from corpora, etc. Tricks can sometimes be invented to compensate for the lack of resources. For example, if there is no oral corpus with transcriptions, it is possible to constitute an oral corpus of read texts.



Finally, it is necessary to take into account the socio-economic constraints exerted on the population of speakers: economic resources are limited, qualified human resources are scarce, research is sporadic and isolated, results confidential and fragmented. It is therefore necessary to define methodologies that are economical in the cost of purchasing software and in skilled labor time aimed at producing long-lasting, shared results that are easy to enrich. The constitution of linguistic resources in general, and even more so for African languages, should therefore respect a certain number of principles: use of open source tools, definition and use of standards (ISO, Unicode), transfer of knowledge between colleagues countries of the North and the South,



The aim of this workshop is to take stock of the work on the constitution of basic linguistic resources (dictionaries, oral and written corpora), to develop simple and economical methodologies for the development of resources, to discuss the techniques which make it possible to dispense with certain non-existent resources and to set a certain number of principles for future work in the field.

The workshop will take place over a half or full day, subject to submissions and final decision by TALN's program committee.



The TALAf workshops are supported by the LTT association (Lexicologie Terminologie Traduction).

【數位典藏與數位人文國際研討會】



「數位典藏與數位人文國際研討會」自從2009年年底開辦以降，透過主題的導引與議程的規劃，研擬如何將現代資訊科技融入傳統人文領域的探索，並嘗試克服甚或超越過去人文研究從材料運用到課題設定的種種侷限。所謂「十年磨一劍」，經過十年來的淬礪鍛鍊，轉眼間已邁入第二個十年的新階段，正待論劍試鋒。中央研究院數位文化中心承辦第十一屆「數位典藏與數位人文國際研討會」（11th International Conference of Digital Archives and Digital Humanities, DADH 2020），特此廣邀各國各界的專家學者登壇列席、共襄盛舉。

 



面對數位人文學方興未艾的新興領域，本次大會除延續過去歷年來對數位人文研究各項層面的關注之外，將更以「智慧資料 ╳ 數位人文」（Smart Data ╳ Digital Humanities）為主題，號召學者們集思廣益，探索如何轉化數位典藏所持續積蓄的各類巨量資料，藉由與時俱進的語意網與人工智慧的技術開發，讓巨量的資料庫不僅只是一座靜態的孤立倉庫，被動地讓研究者從中檢搜線索，而更能主動針對研究者的設想與提問，提供動態鏈結的知識圖譜。簡而言之，將資料結構化使其更為好用。

 



目前全球新冠病毒的疫情尚未見全面抑制，或許影響近距實體的研討對話，但絕無法阻礙我們藉由遠端連線的同步交流。今年我們將採取線上視訊會議的形式，歡迎所有關心數位人文研究發展的先進與同道，透過雲端的交流集思廣益，在邁向新的十年之際，一起思考數位人文學各種可能的里程與遠景。"

MOTIVATIONS

====================

In the last few years the phenomenon of multilingual information overload has received significant attention due to the huge availability of information coded in many different languages. Recent statistics (http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/#byregion) have reported that non-English contents represent more than half of the information available on the Internet. We have in fact witnessed a growing popularity of tools that are designed for collaboratively editing through contributors across the world, which has led to an increased demand for methods capable of effectively and efficiently searching, retrieving, managing and mining different language-written document collections. The multilingual information overload phenomenon introduces new challenges to modern information retrieval systems. By better searching, indexing, and organizing such rich and heterogeneous information, we can discover and exchange knowledge at a larger world-wide scale.

However, since research on multilingual information is relatively young, important issues still remain, including:



* how to define a translation-independent representation of the documents across many languages;

* whether existing solutions for comparable corpora can be enhanced to generalize to multiple languages without depending on bilingual dictionaries or incurring bias in merging language-specific results;

* how to profitably exploit knowledge bases to enable translation-independent preserving and unveiling of content semantics;

* how to define proper indexing structures and multidimensional data structures to better capture the multi-topic and/or multi-aspect nature of the documents in a multilingual context;

* how to detect duplicate or redundant information among different languages or, conversely, novelty in the produced information;

* how to enrich and update multi-lingual knowledge bases from documents;

* how to exploit multi-lingual knowledge bases for question answering;

* how to extend topic modeling to deal with multi/cross-lingual documents;

* how to evaluate and visualize retrieval and mining results.





AIMS AND SCOPE

================================================================



The aim of this workshop, to be held in conjunction with the 2016 ECIR Conference, is to establish a venue to discuss research advances in cross-/multilingual related topics.

A major objective of this workshop is to focus on research questions that have not been deeply investigated so far. In particular, we solicit contributions that aim to consider the following aspects:



* Modeling: methods to develop suitable representations for multilingual corpora, possibly embedding information from different views/aspects, such as, e.g., tensor models and decompositions, word-to-vector models, statistical topic models, representational learning, etc.

* Learning: any unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised approach in cross/multilingual contexts.

* The use of knowledge bases to support the modeling, learning, or both stages of multilingual corpora analysis.

* Emerging trends and applications, such as, e.g., cross-view cross-/multilingual IR, multilingual text mining in social networks, etc.



The workshop will increase the visibility of the above research themes, and will also bridge closely related research fields such as information access, searching and ranking, information extraction, feature engineering, text mining.



The workshop is mainly geared towards students, researchers and practitioners actively working on topics related to information retrieval, classification, clustering, indexing and modeling of multilingual corpora collections. As a (soft) prerequisite, the audience should be knowledgeable about basics on information retrieval and data mining.





TOPICS OF INTEREST

======================



Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Multilingual/cross-lingual information access, web search, and ranking

* Multilingual/cross-lingual relevance feedback

* Multilingual/cross-lingual text summarization

* Multilingual/cross-lingual question answering

* Multilingual/cross-lingual relation extraction

* Multilingual/cross-lingual information extraction

* Multilingual/cross-lingual document indexing

* Multilingual/cross-lingual topic modeling

* Multi-view/Multimodal representation models for multilingual corpora and cross-lingual applications

* Cross-view multi/cross-lingual information retrieval and document mining

* Multilingual/cross-lingual classification and clustering

* Probabilistic models for learning from multilingual corpora

* Knowledge-based approaches to model and mine multilingual corpora

* Social network analysis and mining for multilinguality/cross-linguality

* Plagiarism detection for multilinguality/cross-linguality

* Sentiment analysis for multilinguality/cross-linguality

* Deep learning for multilinguality/cross-linguality

* Novel validity criteria for cross-/multilingual retrieval and learning tasks

* Novel paradigms for visualization of patterns mined in multilingual corpora

* Emerging applications for multilingual/cross-lingual domains

The bi-annual meeting of the German Society for Computational Linguistics

and Language Technology (GSCL) in 2015 will take place from September 30

to October 2 at the University of Duisburg-Essen.



The GSCL Organizing Committee invites proposals for workshops and tutorials to be held in conjunction with the GSCL conference. We solicit proposals on any topic of interest to the ACL/GSCL communities, including, but not limited to topics in Natural Language Processing or interdisciplinary research areas between computational linguistics and other research fields (machine learning, web 2.0, semantic web, psychology etc.).



Workshops provide an opportunity to discuss current topics in a small and interactive atmosphere. They can concentrate in-depth on research topics, but can also be devoted to application issues, or to questions concerning the economic and social aspects of NLP and web mining. Although we encourage workshops on novel and original topics, we also accept successors to workshops at previous ACL, GSCL or related conferences.





WORKSHOPS



Workshops will be half-day or full-day and will be held on

*September 28 or 29, 2015*



Proposals will be reviewed by the conference organizing committee.





SUBMISSION DETAILS

Proposals for workshops should contain:

1. A title and brief (2-page max) description of the workshop topic and content.

2. An estimate of the number of attendees.

3. The desired workshop length -- half-day or full-day.

4. The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of the organizers, with one-paragraph statements of their research interests and areas of expertise.

5. A list of potential members of the program committee, with an indication of which members have already agreed to serve.

TUTORIALS



The GSCL-2015 Organizing Committee invites proposals for half-day tutorials.

Tutorials are intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to core techniques and areas of interest for the GSCL community. We are interested in tutorials on established or emerging research topics in these areas but we also welcome tutorials from related research fields or applications. The ideal tutorial should attract a wide audience. It should be broad enough to provide a basic introduction to the chosen research area, but it should also cover the most important topics in depth. Each tutorial should be well-focused so that its content can be covered in a half day slot (3.5h including a 30-minute break). Proposals that exclusively focus on the presenter's own work, a particular project or commercial presentations are discouraged.

Tutorial slides will be made available online at the main conference website; authors can provide them in additional websites as well.

Tutorial speakers will be offered the possibility of a reduced or waived registration fee, depending on the number of speakers for the tutorial.



SUBMISSION DETAILS

The tutorial proposals should contain:

1. A title and abstract of the tutorial.

2. A brief description of the tutorial content and its relevance to the GSCL community (no more than 2 pages).

3. A brief outline of the tutorial structure showing that the tutorial's core content can be covered in a 3.5 hours slot (including a coffee break).

4. The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of the tutorial instructors, including one-paragraph statement of their research interests and areas of expertise.

5. A list of previous venues and approximate audience sizes, if the same or a similar tutorial has been given elsewhere; otherwise an estimate of the audience size.

6. A description of special requirements for technical equipment (e.g., internet access).



Proposals should be submitted in PDF by electronic mail

*no later than March 1, 2015*

to: gscl2015@gscl.org

The subject line should be: ""GSCL-2015: TUTORIAL PROPOSAL"".



The proponents will receive an email confirmation that their proposal has been received. If no confirmation arrives within 72 hours after sending the proposal, the proponents should contact the tutorial chair again.



GSCL will offer publicity of the tutorials on the GSCL website, free rooms for up to 25-30 people (larger rooms might be arranged, if an application indicates higher foreseen attendance), no separate registration fee (covered by main registration), as well as a complimentary coffee break.



PROPOSAL REVIEW

All proposals will be reviewed by the organizing committee, who may use the help of external reviewers on the submission topics.

The features that will be evaluated are: (i) the interestingness for the GSCL areas, which should result in a large audience; (ii) the clarity of the tutorial, which should emerge from its description; (iii) good organization as appearing from the outline; (iv) the adequacy of the speakers, i.e., her/his background/experience in teaching the target topics; and (v) the ability to explain the topics to a large audience with heterogeneous background.

Accepted tutorial speakers will be asked to provide an abstract (ASCII format) of their tutorials for advertisement purposes in the conference website. Tutorial speakers must provide their tutorial materials (pdf format), at least containing copies of the course slides as well as a bibliography for the material covered in the tutorial, by August 31, 2015.

Background and Motivation



While computing has become almost ubiquitous in the US and Europe, its spread in Asia is more recent. However, despite the fact that Asia is a dense area in terms of linguistic diversity (or perhaps because of it), many Asian languages are very inadequately supported on computers. Even basic NLP tools are not available for these languages. This is a major bottleneck in the development of advanced NLP applications and language resources and it also has a social cost.



NLP/CL based technologies are now becoming important and future intelligent systems will use more of these techniques. Most of the NLP/CL tools and technologies are tailored for English or European languages. Recently, there has been a rapid growth of IT industry in many Asian countries. This is now the right time to address the problem mentioned above, namely lack of computing support and basic NLP tools for less privileged languages. Only when a basic infrastructure for supporting regional languages becomes available can we hope for a more equitable availability of opportunities made possible by language technology. There have already been attempts in this direction (some of them are mentioned below) and this workshop will try to take them further, especially in the Asian context.

Workshop Goals



The purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested in archiving language data, developing language resources, providing basic computing support and creating natural language tools for less privileged languages. Some of these languages are (arguably) Malayalam, Gujarati, Maithili, Assamese, Burmese, Nepali and even tribal languages. They may or may not be low density languages, but the common feature among them is that they are not adequately supported on the computers and not many CL/NLP tools or resources exist for them. The workshop is open to any less privileged (in the above sense) language of the world, even though the focus will be on Asian languages.



We also invite novel approaches which can exploit the similarities among many languages. One of these could be a relatively more privileged language and can be treated as a pivot language around which resources and tools are developed for related but less privileged languages with minimum effort. For example, in the South Asian context, Hindi could be treated as the pivot language and resources and tools for languages like Punjabi, Urdu, Gujarati etc. could be developed as extensions of the resources and tools for Hindi. Perhaps minimally supervised algorithms could be used to achieve this.



Papers are invited on substantial, original and unpublished research on following aspects of NLP for LPL, including but not limited to:



    * Archiving and creation of interoperable data and metadata for less privileged languages.

    * Support for less privileged language on computers. This includes input methods, display, fonts, encoding converters, spell checkers, more linguistically aware text editors etc.

    * Basic NLP tools such as sentence marker, tokenizer, morphological analyzer, transliteration tools, language and encoding identifiers etc.

    * Advanced NLP tools such as POS taggers, local word grouper, approximate string search, tools for making development of language resources easier.



Submission



Paper submission is through the centralized workshop submission page. Papers have to be written in English. There are two categories of papers: long and short. Long papers can be up to 8 pages long, while the maximum length for short papers is 5 pages (including references, figures, tables etc.). All selected papers will be published in the workshop proceedings.



The papers should be formatted using the LaTeX styles or MS Word templates recommended for the main IJCNLP conference. These documents are available here. Reviewing will be blind. The draft papers should not contain any information that can identify the authors, as far as possible.

The ACL 2008 Program Committee invites proposals for the

Demonstrations Program.  We encourage both the exhibition of early

research prototypes and interesting mature systems.  Commercial sales

and marketing activities are not appropriate in the Demonstrations

Program, and should be arranged as part of the Exhibit Program.



We invite proposals for two types of demonstrations:



- Type I: theater-style, as part of the regular program



- Type II: poster-style, where demos are to be presented on table tops

  in sessions scheduled for a specific time slot.



Areas of Interest

-----------------



The special theme for ACL 2008 is ""interfaces for NLP systems"".  We

especially encourage work that attempts to bridge the fields of

human-computer interaction (HCI) and computational linguistics.  Work

of interest includes, but is not limited to:



* User interfaces for monolingual and multilingual information access

  systems, including retrieval, summarization, and QA engines

* Dialogue and conversational systems

* Visualization tools

* Tools that assist in the development of other NLP applications

  (e.g., error analysis)



In addition, proposals for demonstrations of software related to any

aspect of computational linguistics are solicited.  Areas of interest

include, but are not limited to:



* End-to-end natural language processing systems

* Applications using embedded language technology components

* Reusable components (parsers, generators, speech recognizers, etc.)

* Software tools for facilitating computational linguistics research

* Software for evaluating natural language systems and components

* Aids for teaching computational linguistics concepts





Format for Submission

---------------------



Demo proposals consist of the following parts, which should all be

sent to the Demo Chair.  Please use the main ACL paper formatting

guidelines.

The International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media

(ICWSM) is a unique forum that brings together researchers from

the disciplines of computer science, linguistics, communication,

and the social sciences. The broad goal of ICWSM is to increase

understanding of social media in all its incarnations.

Submissions describing research that blends social science and

computational approaches are especially encouraged.



Though this conference is just in its sixth year, it has become

one of the premier venues for social scientists and technologists

to gather and discuss cutting-edge research in social media. This

is largely due to a typical acceptance rate of 20% for

full-length research papers published in our conference

proceedings and support from the Association for the Advancement

of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).



For ICWSM-12, in addition to the usual program of contributed

technical talks, posters and invited presentations, the main

conference will include a selection of keynote talks from

prominent social scientists and technologists. Building on the

success of the first workshops program in 2011 and our regular

tutorials day, ICWSM-12 will also hold a workshops and tutorials

day just before the main conference.

Author Submission Account

-------------------------



Authors must set up an account (or add ICWSM-12 to your list of

conferences) at the ICWSM-12 web-based technical paper submission

site, which will be available November 1, 2011. Please make a

note of your password, as this will allow you to log on to submit

an abstract and paper. In order to avoid a rush at the last

minute, authors are encouraged to set up their account as soon as

possible, and well in advance of the January 13, 2012 abstract

deadline.



Abstract and Paper Submission

-----------------------------



Electronic abstract submission through the ICWSM-12 paper

submission site is required on or preferably before January 13,

2012 at 11:59 PM PST. Full papers are due via the submission site

no later than Monday, January 18, 2012 at midnight PST. We cannot

accept submissions by e-mail or fax. Authors will receive

confirmation of receipt of their abstracts and papers, including

a paper number, shortly after submission. AAAI will contact

authors again only if problems are encountered with papers.



Content Guidelines

------------------



Submissions to other conferences or journals: ICWSM-12 will not

accept any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review

for or has already been published or accepted for publication in

a journal or conference. This restriction does not apply to

submissions for workshops and other venues with a limited

audience. If in doubt please contact the PC Chairs.



If duplicate submissions are identified during the review process

then:



* All submissions from that author will be disqualified from the

 current ICWSM conference;

* And authors will not be permitted to submit papers to the ICWSM

 conference in the following year.



_Format:_ Papers must be in trouble-free, high resolution PDF

format, formatted for US Letter (8.5"" x 11"") paper, using Type 1

or TrueType fonts. Full papers must be no longer than 8 pages,

including references, poster papers must be no longer than 4

pages, and demo descriptions must be no longer than 2 pages, and

all must be submitted by the deadlines given above, and formatted

in AAAI two-column, camera-ready style (see the author

instructions page ). Please note that the formatting and

submission instructions at the author site are for final,

accepted papers; no additional pages can be purchased at the

review stage. In addition, the copyright slug may be omitted in

the initial submission phase and no copyright form is required

until a paper is accepted for publication.



_Anonymity:_ ICWSM-12 review is double-blind. Therefore, please

anonymize your submission: do not put the author(s) names or

affiliation(s) at the start of the paper, and do not include

funding or other acknowledgments in papers submitted for review.

Citations to authors’ own prior relevant work should be included,

either by not specifying that this is the authors’ own work, or

where this is not possible, by anonymizing the citation itself.

It is up to the authors' discretion how much to further modify

the body of the paper to preserve anonymity. The requirement for

anonymity does not extend outside of the review process, e.g. the

authors can decide how widely to distribute their papers over the

Internet before the program committee meeting. Even in cases

where the author’s identity is known to a reviewer, the double

blind process will serve as a symbolic reminder of the importance

of evaluating the submitted work on its own merits without regard

to authors’ reputation.



_Language:_ All submissions must be in English.



Conference Registration

-----------------------



All accepted papers and extended abstracts will be published in

the conference proceedings. At least one author must register for

the conference by the deadline for camera-ready copy submission.

In addition, the registered author must attend the conference to

present the paper in person.



Publication

-----------



All accepted papers and abstracts will be allocated eight (8)

pages in the conference proceedings. Authors will be required to

transfer copyright of their paper to AAAI.



Datasets

--------



This year, for the first time, we will be providing a service for

hosting datasets pertaining to research presented at the

conference. Authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to

share the datasets on which their papers are based, while

adhering to the terms and conditions of the data provider. Of

these datasets, one will be selected for an award which will be

based on the quality, scope, and timeliness of each dataset. More

information will be available on our website.

WILDRE – the 4th workshop on Indian Language Data: Resources and Evaluation is being organized in Miyazaki, Japan on 12h May 2018 under the LREC platform.  India has a huge linguistic diversity and has seen concerted efforts from the Indian government and industry towards developing language resources. European Language Resource Association (ELRA) and its associate organizations have been very active and successful in addressing the challenges and opportunities related to language resource creation and evaluation. It is therefore a great opportunity for resource creators of Indian languages to showcase their work on this platform and also to interact and learn from those involved in similar initiatives all over the world. The broader objectives of the WILDRE will be

To map the status of Indian Language Resources

To investigate challenges related to creating and sharing various levels of language resources

To promote a dialogue between language resource developers and users

To provide opportunity for researchers from India to collaborate with researchers from other parts of the world

The First Workshop on Multi-Language Processing in a Globalising World (MLP2017), organized by ADAPT Centre, Dublin City University (DCU), Ireland, will be held at DCU on September 4–5, 2017.

​

Globalisation has, on the one hand, brought us significant growth in free international trade and cross-cultural communication, as well as access to newly-developed technology, media, education, healthcare, consumer goods, etc. On the other hand, it may have negative impacts on local societies, such as cultural homogenisation. To embrace cultural diversity and multilingual phenomena, experts with research interests in different languages are invited to participate in this workshop. This international workshop will be organised as a forum and we invite natural language processing researchers and linguists to come together to discuss the current status and future directions of research in multilingualism and minority languages in this globalising world.

​

The workshop aims to provide a research forum dedicated to state-of-the-art methods and techniques on multi-language and cross-language processing and exploring the use of such technologies in specific tasks. The workshop will solicit original and ongoing research contributions related to the theme, which includes but are not limited to:



    Theoretical and applied linguistic research for multilinguality and minority languages



    Text encoding theory and transcoding techniques



    Resource construction, such as multilingual corpora and corpora for minority languages



    Speech, lexical, syntactic, semantic analytics for multiple languages or minority languages



    Cross-language adaptation for natural language processing



    Multi-language, cross-language and minority language processing methods and applications in machine translation, speech recognition, information retrieval etc.

ICAART 2015 Special Session on Partiality, Underspecification, and Natural Language Processing (PUaNLP 2015)



Lisbon (Portugal)

10-12 January, 2015



http://www.icaart.org/PUaNLP.aspx





SCOPE



Computational and technological developments that incorporate natural language are proliferating. Adequate coverage encounters difficult problems related to partiality, underspecification, and context-dependency, which are signature features of information in nature and natural languages. Furthermore, agents (humans or computational systems) are information conveyors, interpreters, or participate as components of informational content. Generally, language expression depends on agents' knowledge, reasoning, perspectives, and interactions. The session covers theoretical work, approaches, and techniques for computational models of information and its presentation by language. The goal is to promote intelligent natural language processing and related models of thought, mental states, reasoning, and other cognitive processes. Computational neuroscience of information and language is of special interest, with existing or potential applications to Artificial Intelligence.



TOPICS



The session invites contributions relevant to the following topics, without limitations to them: 



* Type theories for applications to language and information processing

* Computational grammar of natural language 

* Computational semantics of natural languages 

* Computational syntax-semantics interface 

* Parsing 

* Multilingual processing 

* Large-scale grammars of natural languages

* Models of computation and algorithms for natural language processing 

* Integration of interdisciplinary methods, e.g., formal, symbolic, model theoretic, and other computational methods 

* Computational models of partiality, underspecification, and context-dependency 

* Models of situations, contexts, and agents, for applications to language processing 

* Bio-information and natural language 

* Language processing based on biological fundamentals of information and languages 

* Computational neuroscience of language

Call for papers

---------------



This panel at ISHS 2018 solicits abstract submissions on the implementation of humor detection and generation systems in artificial intelligence environments.



Humor as a universal and ubiquitously used human ability has proven to be among the hardest to simulate in these environments. But progress is continuous and should be reported on at the most important international conference on humor. The main field contributing to humor and AI is natural language processing (computational linguistics), where currently deep learning methods are de rigueur. But these are more successful at visual processing than symbolic systems, which are the basis of humor. Simpler tasks, like template-based joke generation and rule-based or machine-learned joke detection, are seeing more recent advances. Beyond these narrower approaches, any researcher in artificial intelligence and humor from any field should feel welcome to this panel.

SHARED TASK: Bilingual dictionary induction from comparable corpora



Website workshop: https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2020/



Website shared task: https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2020/bucc2020-task.html



Invited speaker: Holger Schwenk, Facebook AI Research



**************************************************************



MOTIVATION



In the language engineering and the linguistics communities, research in comparable corpora has been motivated by two main reasons. In language engineering, on the one hand, it is chiefly motivated by the need to use comparable corpora as training data for statistical NLP applications such as statistical and neural machine translation or cross-lingual retrieval. In linguistics, on the other hand, comparable corpora are of interest in themselves by making possible cross-language discoveries and comparisons. It is generally accepted in both communities that comparable corpora are documents in one or several languages that are comparable in content and form in various degrees and dimensions. We believe that the linguistic definitions and observations related to comparable corpora can improve methods to mine such corpora for applications of statistical NLP. As such, it is of great interest to bring together builders and users of such corpora. 





TOPICS



We solicit contributions on all topics related to comparable 

corpora, including but not limited to the following:

 

Building Comparable Corpora:



• Human translations

• Automatic and semi-automatic methods

• Methods to mine parallel and non-parallel corpora from the web

• Tools and criteria to evaluate the comparability of corpora

• Parallel vs non-parallel corpora, monolingual corpora

• Rare and minority languages, across language families

• Multi-media/multi-modal comparable corpora



Applications of comparable corpora:



• Human translations

• Language learning

• Cross-language information retrieval & document categorization

• Bilingual projections

• Machine translation

• Writing assistance

• Machine learning techniques using comparable corpora



Mining from Comparable Corpora:



• Induction of morphological, grammatical, and translation rules from comparable corpora 

• Extraction of parallel segments or paraphrases from comparable corpora 

• Extraction of bilingual and multilingual translations of single words and multi-word expressions, proper names, and named entities from comparable corpora 

• Induction of multilingual word classes from comparable corpora

• Cross-language distributional semantics





SUBMISSION INFORMATION



Please follow the style sheet and templates provided for the main conference at http://lrec2020.lrec-conf.org/en/submission/authors-kit/

Further details on the submission procedure are provided on the workshop website.

SHARED TASK: Bilingual dictionary induction from comparable corpora



In the framework of machine translation, the extraction of bilingual dictionaries from parallel corpora has been conducted very successfully. On the other hand, human second language acquisition appears not to be based on parallel data. This means that there must be a way of acquiring and relating lexical knowledge in two or more languages without the use of parallel data.



It has been suggested that it might also be possible to extract multilingual lexical knowledge from comparable rather than from parallel corpora. From a theoretical perspective, this suggestion might lead to advances in understanding human second language acquisition. From a practical perspective, as comparable corpora are available in much larger quantities than parallel corpora, this approach might help in relieving the data acqisition bottleneck which tends to be especially severe when dealing with language pairs involving low resource languages.



A well established practical task to approach this topic is bilingual lexicon induction from comparable corpora, which is  in the focus of the current shared task. Typically, its aim is to extract word translations such as the following from comparable corpora:



English / French



baby (-) bébé

baby (-) poupon

bath (-) bain

bed (-) lit

bed (-) plumard

convenience (-) commodité

doctor (-) médecin

doctor (-) docteur

eagle (-) aigle

mountain (-) montagne

nervous (-) nerveux

work (-) travail



Quite a few research groups have been working on this problem using a wide variety of approaches. However, as there is no standard way to measure the performance of the systems, the published results are not comparable and the pros and cons of the various approaches are not clear. 



The shared task aims at solving these problems by organizing a fair competition between systems. This is accomplished by providing corpora and evaluation datasets for a number of language pairs involving Chinese, English, French, German, Russian and Spanish and by comparing the results using a common evaluation framework. Other language pairs might be added on request.



Any submission to the shared task is expected to be accompanied by a system description paper (4 to 6 pages plus references). This will be accepted for publication in the workshop proceedings after a basic quality check.



Note that participation in the workshop, although we strongly encourage it, is not mandatory for participating in the shared task. 



Further information on the shared task as well as the data sets is provided on the shared task website at https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2020/bucc2020-task.html

INFORMATION FROM THE LREC ORGANIZERS



Please make sure that your papers take into account the following information about the LRE Map, the ""Share your LRs!"" initiative and the ISLRN number:



Describing your LRs in the LRE Map is now a normal practice in the submission procedure of LREC (introduced in 2010 and adopted by other conferences). To continue the efforts initiated at LREC 2014 about “Sharing LRs” (data, tools, web-services, etc.), authors will have the possibility, when submitting a paper, to upload LRs in a special LREC repository. This effort of sharing LRs, linked to the LRE Map for their description, may become a new “regular” feature for conferences in our field, thus contributing to creating a common repository where everyone can deposit and share data.



As scientific work requires accurate citations of referenced work so as to allow the community to understand the whole context and also replicate the experiments conducted by other researchers, LREC 2020 endorses the need to uniquely Identify LRs through the use of the International Standard Language Resource Number (ISLRN, www.islrn.org), a Persistent Unique Identifier to be assigned to each Language Resource. The assignment of ISLRNs to LRs cited in LREC papers will be offered at submission time."

Renowned for their complexity, they are the subject of several studies aimed at their modeling and exploration at all linguistic levels. In the French-speaking research landscape, studies are conducted on very heterogeneous languages ​​in this group, ranging from Southeast Slavic (Bulgarian, Macedonian) and Southwestern (BCMS and Slovenian) languages ​​to the Slavic languages ​​of the East (Russian, Belarusian, Ukrainian and Ruthenian) and West (Polish, Czech, Slovak, Upper Sorbian and Lower Sorbian). The aim of the workshop we are offering is to bring together NLP researchers with Slavic languages,



We propose to organize this workshop in two distinct parts of 2h00 each with a closing round table. The first section entitled ""Modeling"" aims to bring together papers that revolve around the notion of modeling linguistic data at different levels of analysis (morphological, syntactic, semantic and discursive) with a view to their computer processing. Indeed, we will examine the suitability of modeling and its implementation in automatic processing systems, as well as its applicability to other Slavic languages. The second section entitled ""Resources and applications"" will be devoted to the presentation of applications, tools and resources resulting from modeling.



We are expecting short articles (from 6 to 8 pages including references) or long (from 9 to 12 pages including references) which could deal with the following themes (non-exhaustive list):
 
- modeling in contrastive linguistics (between the different Slavic languages ​​or between French and Slavic languages);

-formalization of data of a morphological, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, discursive nature;

- translation problems: divergences and convergences, disambiguation;

- automatic processing: automatic translation, processing of bi- and multilingual data;

- bi- and multilingual tools and databases, parallel corpora, bi- and multilingual lexicons and terminologies.



Articles (short or long) must be between 6 and 12 pages in ATALA format downloadable at the following address: https://taln2015.greyc.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Styles-v1.zip.

ABOUT TIA 2011



It is widely held that we are living in an era in which global

communication technology has enabled us to transcend borders and

that we are witnessing the advent of a global community. Although

this oft-repeated claim is not without foundation, it is also an

undeniable reality that one of the greatest obstacles to global

communication -- the language barrier -- remains almost intact

and manifests itself in every facet of global communication.



Parallel to this, certain trends - which perhaps emerged quite a

while ago - have intensified to such an extent that they have become

issues of serious concern. One is the fragmentation not only of

scientific subjects but also of non-scientific activities, and the

accompanying subdivision of communications, even within a single

language. For example, mathematicians working on different topics

use different terminology sets, and the intersection between the jargon

used by gamers and that used by musicians is minimal; even among gamers,

different jargons are used depending on the type and genre of the game.

The other is the massively reduced life expectancy of terms in

cutting-edge spheres. It is not uncommon to find that a set of terms

one learned several years ago is no longer in use.



While multilingual terminology is a well-established research topic,

these changes in the environment in which the topic is situated have

given it a new dimension and increased the challenges involved in

researching it. It is against this backdrop that we chose multilingual

aspects of terminology as the central topic for TIA 2011, while

at the same time welcoming a broad range of related topics.



TIA 2011 will be the ninth event in the successful series which started

out as a predominantly francophone conference. The conference has

gradually attracted a wider audience and over the past six years it

has grown to be a truly international conference. Welcome to TIA 2011!





TOPICS



Papers can address theoretical questions or methodological aspects.

Interdisciplinary work which emphasizes the convergence and

co-operation of multiple disciplines dealing with terminological

issues is welcome.



Papers addressing specific issues linked to the topic of multilingual

terminology will be particularly welcome, but we are also soliciting

original contributions on any of the following topics with a theoretical,

methodological or practical orientation:



Terminology acquisition and management

 * term acquisition

 * terminology structuring: acquisition of relations

 * terms as named entities

 * terminology evolution

 * terminology evaluation

 * multimodal information management in terminology



Terminology and knowledge representation

 * ontology construction from terminological resources

 * status of linguistic semantics and ontology

 * knowledge evolution and terminological dynamics



Terminology for applications

 * terminology in industrial applications

 * terminology in education

 * terminology for human translation

 * terminology for machine translation

 * terminology for natural language processing

FORMAT OF SUBMISSIONS



TIA 2011 solicits both regular papers, which present significant

work, and short papers, which typically present work in progress

or a smaller, focused contribution.The program committee may

decide to change the category of a paper before acceptance.



Regular papers, in English or French, should not exceed 7 pages in

ACL-HLT 2011 format (see below for LaTeX and MS Word style files),

including figures, examples and references. The mode of presentation

of long papers (orally or as posters) will be decided based on the

It is generally agreed upon that ""linguistic creativity"" is a unique property of human language. Some claim that linguistic creativity is expressed in our ability to combine known words in a new sentence, others refer to our skill to express thoughts in figurative language, and yet others talk about syntactic recursion and lexical creativity.



For the purpose of this workshop, we treat the term ""linguistic creativity"" to mean ""creative language usage at different levels"", from the lexicon to syntax to discourse and text (see also topics, below).



The recognition of instances of linguistic creativity and the computation of their meaning constitute one of the most challenging problems for a variety of Natural Language Processing tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization, information retrieval, question answering, and sentiment analysis. Computational systems incorporating models of linguistic creativity operate on different types of data (including written text, audio/speech/sound, and video/images/gestures). New approaches might combine information from different modalities. Creativity-aware systems will improve the contribution Computational Linguistics has to offer to many practical areas, including education, entertainment, and engineering.



Within the scope of the workshop, the event is intended to be interdisciplinary. Besides contributions from an NLP perspective, we also welcome the participation of researchers who deal with linguistic creativity from different perspectives, including psychology, neuroscience, or human-computer interaction.



 Topics



We are particularly interested in work on the automatic detection, classification, understanding, or generation of:



    * neologisms;

    * figurative language, including metaphor, metonymy, personification, idioms;

    * new or unconventional syntactic constructions (""May I serve who's next?"") and constructions defying traditional parsers (e.g. gapping: ""Many words were spoken, and sentiments expressed"");

    * indirect speech acts (such as curses, insults, sarcasm and irony);

    * verbally expressed humor;

    * poetry and fiction;

    * and other phenomena illustrating linguistic creativity. 



Depending on the state of the art of approaches to the various phenomena and languages, preference will be given to work on deeper processing (e.g., understanding, goal-driven generation) rather than shallow approaches (e.g., binary classification, random generation). We also welcome descriptions and discussions of:



    * computational tools that support people in using language creatively (e.g. tools for computer-assisted creative writing, intelligent thesauri);

    * computational and/or cognitive models of linguistic creativity;

    * metrics and tools for evaluating the performance of creativity-aware systems;

    * specific application scenarios of computational linguistic creativity;

    * design and implementation of creativity-aware systems. 



Related topics, including corpora collection, elicitation, and annotation of creative language usage, will also be considered, as long as their relevance to automatic systems is clearly pointed out.



Invited Talk



Nick Montfort (MIT): Curveship: A System for Interactive Fiction and Interactive Narrating



Interactive fiction (often called ""IF"") is a venerable thread of creative 

computing that includes Adventure, Zork, and the computer game The 

Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, as well as innovative recent work. These 

programs are usually known as ""games,"" appropriately, but they can also be 

rich forms of text-based computer simulation, dialog systems, and examples 

of computational literary art. Theorists of narrative have long 

distinguished between the level of underlying content or story (which can 

usefully be seen as corresponding to the simulated world in interactive 

fiction) and that of expression or discourse (corresponding to the textual 

exchange between computer and user). While IF development systems have 

offered a great deal of power and flexibility to author/programmers by 

providing a computational model of the fictional world, previous systems 

have not systematically distinguished between the telling and what is 

told. Developers were not able to control the content and expression 

levels independently so that they could, for instance, have a program 

relate events out of chronological order or have it relate events from the 

perspective of different characters. Curveship is an interactive fiction 

system which draws on narrative theory and computational linguistics to 

allow the transformation of the narrating in these ways. This talk will 

briefly describe interactive fiction and narrative variation and will 

detail how Curveship provides these new capabilities.



Submissions



Submissions should describe original, unpublished work. Papers are limited to 8 pages. Style files must be used; see the Submission section on the workshop web page ('link', above). No author information should be included in the papers, since reviewing will be blind. Papers not conforming to these requirements are subject to rejection without review. Papers should be submitted via the START system; more information is available on the workshop web page.



We encourage submissions from everyone. For those how are new to ACL conferences and workshops, or with special needs, we are planning to set up a lunch mentoring program. Let us know if you are interested. Also, a limited number of student travel grants might become available, intended for individuals with minority background and current residents of countries where conference travel funding is usually hard to find.

• typography and spelling;

• lexicons of simple words, multiword units and discontinuous expressions;

• inflectional, derivational and agglutinative morphology;

• local and structural syntax;

• transformational syntax and paraphrase generation;

• semantic analysis and machine translation.



For each of these levels NooJ provides linguists with one or more formal tools  specifically designed to facilitate the description of each phenomenon, as well as parsing/development/debugging tools designed to be as computationally efficient as possible, from Finite-State to Turing machines. The integration of all the linguistic levels in one compatible platform distinguishes NooJ from other computational linguistic frameworks which provide a unique formalism, incompatible with others.



As a corpus processing tool, NooJ allows researchers in various social sciences to extract information from corpora by applying sophisticated queries based on concepts and relations (rather than word forms) and automatically build concordances, add semantic annotations, and perform statistical analyses. NooJ has been endorsed by the Meta-Share CESAR Project of the European Community, is now available as a JAVA open source package and runs under Windows LINUX and Mac OSX platforms. NooJ linguistic modules for over 20 languages are freely available at www.nooj4nlp.net.



The NooJ conference intends to:



• give NooJ users and researchers in Linguistics and in Computational Linguistics the opportunity to meet and share their experience as developers, researchers and teachers;

• present to NooJ users the latest linguistic resources and NLP applications developed for/with NooJ, its latest functionalities, as well as its future developments;

• offer researchers and graduate students two tutorials (one basic and one advanced) to help them parse corpora and build NLP applications using NooJ;

• provide the occasion to present and discover the recent developments of NooJ itself (v3).

held in



České Budějovice (Czech Republic),



9-11 June 2016.



NooJ is both a corpus processing tool and a linguistic development environment that allows linguists to formalize several levels of linguistic phenomena:

	typography and spelling;

	syllabification, phonemic and prosodic transcription;

	lexicons of simple words, multiword units, and discontinuous expressions;

	inflectional, derivational and agglutinative morphology;

	local and structural syntax;

	semantic analysis and machine translation.

NooJ provides linguists with regular grammars, context-free grammars, context-sensitive grammars, and unrestricted grammars as well as their graphical equivalent (finite-state, recursive and contextual graphs) to facilitate the description of each phenomenon. NooJ’s multi-layer approach allows linguists to accumulate elementary descriptions and describe phenomena that cross linguistic levels. As a corpus processing tool, NooJ allows users to apply sophisticated linguistic queries to large corpora in real time, in order to construct indices and concordances, annotate texts automatically, and perform semantic and statistical analyses, etc.

NooJ is open-source, freely available at www.nooj4nlp.net, and over 20 linguistic modules can already be freely downloaded, as well as a manual, video tutorials, references, etc.

We are pleased to announce our invited talks for ALTA 2017:



Title: Characterising information and happiness in online social activity

Speaker: Dr Lewis Mitchell

Position: Lecturer in Applied Mathematics

Affiliation: University of Adelaide



Biography:

Lewis’s research focusses on large-scale methods for extracting useful information from online social networks, and on mathematical techniques for inference and prediction using these data. He works on building tools for real-time estimation of social phenomena such as happiness from written text, and prediction of population-level events like disease outbreaks, elections, and civil unrest.



Title: Commercialised NLP: The State of the Art

Speaker: Dr Robert Dale

Position: Principal Consultant

Affiliation: Language Technology Group Pty Ltd



Biography:

Robert Dale runs the Language Technology Group, an independent consultancy providing unbiased advice to corporations and businesses on the selection and deployment of NLP technologies.  Until recently, he was Chief Technology Officer of Arria NLG, where he led the development of a cloud-based natural language generation tool; prior to joining Arria in 2012, he held a chair in the Department of Computing at Macquarie University in Sydney, where he was Director of that university’s Centre for Language Technology.  After receiving his PhD from the University of Edinburgh in 1989, he taught there for several years before moving to Sydney in 1994.  He played a foundational role in building up the NLP community in Australia, and was editor in chief of the Computational Linguistics journal from 2003 to 2012. He writes a semi-regular column titled ‘Industry Watch’ for the Journal of Natural Language Engineering.



#Tutorials



We are very happy to announce the following tutorial:



Tutorial Presentation: Ben Hachey

Tutorial Development: Ben Hachey, Will Radford, Bo Han



Working Title: Active Learning… and Beyond! 🚀



Working Abstract:

This half-day session will take participants through situations they might face applying Natural Language Processing to real-world problems. We’ll choose a canonical task (text classification) and focus on the main issue that faces practitioners in green fields projects - where does the data come from? Our aim is to equip participants with the theoretical background and practical skills to quickly build high-quality text classification models.



#Format

 

We invite submissions of two different formats: (1) Original Research Papers and (2) Abstract-based Presentations

 

## Original Research Papers

 

We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all aspects of natural language processing.

 

Long papers should be 6-8 pages. Accepted long papers will have a 15 minute slot for oral presentation plus 5 minutes for questions and discussion.

Short papers should be 3-4 pages. Accepted short papers will have a poster presentation plus a short approximately 5 minute talk to advertise the poster.

Both formats may include up to 2 pages of references in addition to these page count requirements.

 

Note that the review process is double-blind, and accordingly submitted papers should not include the identity of author(s) and the text should be suitably anonymised, e.g., using third person wording for self-citations, not providing URLs to your personal website, etc.

 

Original research papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which will be published online in the ACL anthology and the ALTA website. Long papers will be distinguished from short papers in the proceedings.

 

## Abstract-based Presentations

 

To encourage broader participation and facilitate local socialisation of international results, we continue the presentations format introduced last year. We invite submissions of 1-2 page presentation abstracts. These will not be published in the proceedings, but simply reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to ensure that they are on topic, coherent and likely to be of interest to the ALTA community. Abstracts on work in progress and work published or submitted elsewhere are encouraged. ALTA invites submissions of all manner interesting research, not limited to, but including:

 

- established academics giving an overview of an exciting paper or paper/s published in international venues;

- completing research students giving an overview of their thesis work;

- early candidature research students presenting their work-in-progress and ideas, which may not have been published; and

- industry presenting research and development over linguistic data in the context of their business.

 

Presentation abstracts should not be anonymised, any publications relating to the work should be cited in the submission, and the person who will give the presentation should be clearly stated. 

 

# Topics

- linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language;

- NLP-based information extraction and retrieval;

- corpus-based and statistical language modelling;

- machine translation and translation aids;

- question answering and information extraction;

- natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;

- natural language and multimodal systems;

- message and narrative understanding systems;

- evaluations of language systems;

- embodied conversational agents;

- computational lexicography;

- summarisation;

- language resources;

- topic modelling and unsupervised language analysis;

- social media analysis and processing; 

- domain-specific adaptation of natural language processing algorithms; and

- applied natural language processing and/or applications in industry.

 

We particularly encourage submissions that broaden the scope of our community through the consideration of practical applications of language technology and through multi-disciplinary research. We also specifically encourage submissions from industry.

 

#Multiple Submission Policy

 

Original research papers that are under review for other publication venues or that you intend to submit elsewhere may be submitted in parallel to ALTA. We request that you declare at submission that your paper is submitted to another venue, and identify the venue. Should your paper be accepted to both ALTA and another venue, we allow you to decide whether the paper should be published in the ALTA proceedings, or if it should be treated as a Presentation (without archival publication). In this case you would still be able to present a research talk at the ALTA workshop. This is to encourage more internationally leading research to be presented at the workshop.



# Student Funding

As in previous years, ALTA will provide student travel support to attend the workshop.  For more information, please see the ALTA Workshop website.

4. NLP TOOLS CONTESTS:



4.1 WORD ALIGNMENT FROM ENGLISH/IL TO IL USING PARALLEL CORPORA



Machine translation (MT) is the process of encoding the syntactic and semantic information of a source language text into a target language. In the past two decades, MT has shown very promising results particularly using Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) especially for English and other European Languages.



However, its effectiveness in translating sentences within Indian Languages (IL) and between English and Indian languages needs to be explored further. The NLP tools contest in ICON 2016 aims to collectively explore the effectiveness of word alignment techniques for ILs. Better word aligned data can be useful not only for computational (such as SMT) purposes but also for obtaining linguistic insights.



CONTEST:



In the contest, training data will be provided to the contestants. It will consist of word aligned parallel corpus for different ILs and English. The contestants will have to train their systems on the data and build systems that can perform word alignment given sentence aligned parallel corpus. They will be free to use statistical, rule-based or hybrid methods. A development corpus will also be provided to refine and improve their system. The final contest will be held in November, 2016 with the test data. A workshop will be held as a part of ICON to allow the short listed candidates to present their techniques and results.



The details about the language pairs will be announced shortly. We are likely to test word alignment in both directions for all given language pairs.



The details of the evaluation procedure and the use policy of additional resources/tools will also be announced shortly.



The contest will have three prizes:

  FIRST PRIZE: Rs.10,000/-

  SECOND PRIZE: Rs.7,500/-

  THIRD PRIZE: Rs.5,000/-



4.2 POS TAGGING FOR CODE-MIXED INDIAN SOCIAL MEDIA TEXT RATIONALE



The evolution of social media texts such as blogs, micro-blogs (e.g., Twitter), and chats (e.g., Facebook messages) has created many new opportunities for information access and language technology, but also many new challenges, making it one of the prime present-day research areas. Non-English speakers, especially Indians, do not always use Unicode to write something in social media in ILs. Instead, they use phonetic typing/ roman script/ transliteration and frequently insert English words or phrases through code-mixing and anglicisms (see the following example [1]), and often mix multiple languages to express their thoughts.



While it is clear that English still is the principal language for social media communications, there is a growing need to develop technologies for other languages, including Indian languages. India is home to several hundred languages. Language diversity and dialect changes instigate frequent code-mixing in India. Hence, Indians are multi-lingual by adaptation and necessity, and frequently change and mix languages in social media contexts, which poses additional difficulties for automatic Indian social media text processing. Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is an essential prerequisite for any kind of NLP applications.



This year we will continue the last year.s POS tagging shared-task on three widely spoken Indian languages (Hindi, Bengali, and Telugu), mixed with English.



Example 1: ICON 2016 Varanasi me hold hoga! Great chance to see the pracheen nagari!



THE CONTEST



Participants will be provided training, development and test data to report the efficiency of their POS tagging system. English-Hindi, English-Bengali, and English-Telugu language mixing will be explored. The datasets may be provided with some additional information like the languages of each word. Efficiency will be measured in terms of Precision, Recall, and F-measure. Shortlisted candidates will present their techniques and results in a special session at ICON 2016.



The contest will have three prizes:

        FIRST PRIZE: Rs.10,000/-

        SECOND PRIZE: Rs.7,500/-

        THIRD PRIZE: Rs.5,000/-

EVALITA-2020: Diachronic lexical semantics in Italian

Shared Task Website: https://diacr-ita.github.io/DIACR-Ita/

Email: diacrita.evalita@google.com



Researchers and industry professionals are invited to participate in the first shared task on diachronic lexical semantics in Italian (DIACR-Ita) organised within Evalita 2020, the 7th evaluation campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech tools for Italian, which will be held in Bologna (Italy) and will be co-located with CLiC-it 2020 (November 30th – December 3rd 2020).



DIACR-Ita is the first task on lexical semantic change for Italian, combining together computational and historical linguistics. The task challenges participants to develop systems that can automatically detect if a given word has changed its meaning over time, given contextual information from corpora.



DIACR-Ita is a twin task of the Semeval 2020 Task 1: Unsupervised Lexical Semantic Change Detection (https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20948), which has hosted for the first time a task on unsupervised lexical semantic change detection.



---- Task Description ----



The goal of the task is to establish if a set of (target) words change their meaning across two periods, t1 and t2, where t1 precedes t2. Following the SemEval 2020 Task 1 setting, we rely on the comparison of two time periods. In this way we tackle two issues: 1) we reduce the number of time periods for which data has to be annotated; 2) we reduce the task complexity, allowing different model architectures to be applied to it, widening the range of possible participants.



Participants will be provided with two corpora C1 and C2 (for time periods t1 and t2, respectively), and a set of target words. For each of them, systems have to decide whether a word changed or not its meaning between t1 and t2 according to the occurrences of target word(s) in sentences in C1 and C2. For instance, the meaning of the word “imbarcata” is known to have expanded (i.e, it has acquired a new sense) from t1 to t2 (originally it refers to an acrobatic manoeuvre of aeroplanes, but nowadays it is also used to refer to the state of being deeply in love with someone.) This will be reflected in different occurrences of use in sentences between C1 and C2.



The task is formulated as a closed task (i.e., participants must train their models on the data that are provided).



---- Important Dates ----



29th May 2020: Distribution of data sets for training and development

4th September 2020: Distribution of data sets for testing

4th - 24th September 2020: Evaluation windows and collection of participants results

2nd October 2020: Assessment returned to participants

TBD: report due from participants

The Text Analysis Conference (TAC) is a series of evaluation workshops organized to encourage research in Natural Language Processing and related applications, by providing a large test collection, common evaluation procedures, and a forum for organizations to share their results. TAC comprises sets of tasks known as ""tracks,"" each of which focuses on a particular subproblem of NLP. TAC tracks focus on end-user tasks, but also include component evaluations situated within the context of end-user tasks. In the first Text Analysis Conference (TAC 2008), 65 teams participated in one or more tracks, representing 20 different countries and six continents.



You are invited to participate in TAC 2009. NIST will provide test data for each track, and track participants will run their NLP systems on the data and return their results to NIST for evaluation. Organizations may choose to participate in any or all of the tracks. The annual conference culminates in a November workshop at NIST in Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA. All results submitted to NIST are archived on the TAC web site, and all evaluations of submitted results are included in the conference proceedings. Dissemination of TAC work and results other than in the conference proceedings is welcomed, but the conditions of participation specifically preclude any advertising claims based on TAC results.

TRACK DESCRIPTION



TAC 2009 has three tracks. A new Knowledge Base Population track (KBP) joins the Recognizing Textual Entailment track (RTE-5) and the Summarization track, which are both returning from TAC 2008.



What's NEW in 2009:



    * The goal of the new Knowledge Base Population track is to augment an existing knowledge representation with information about entities that is discovered from a collection of documents. A snapshot of Wikipedia infoboxes will be used as the original knowledge source, and participants will be expected to fill in empty slots for entities that do exist, add missing entities and their learnable attributes, and provide links between entities and references to text supporting extracted information. The KBP task lies at the intersection of Question Answering and Information Extraction and is expected to be of particular interest to groups that have participated in ACE or TREC QA.

    * RTE-5 will extend the task of recognizing whether a Text entails a given Hypothesis. The Texts will be longer (to promote discourse analysis) and will not be edited from their source documents; thus, systems will be asked to handle real text that may include typographical errors and ungrammatical sentences.

    * The Summarization track brings back the update summarization task and adds the task of Automatically Evaluating Summaries Of Peers (AESOP) for a given metric. AESOP complements the basic summarization task by building a collection of automatic evaluation tools that support development of summarization systems.



The exact definition of the tasks to be performed in each TAC 2009 track is formulated and discussed on the track mailing list. To be added to a track mailing list, follow the instructions given in the track web page for contacting the mailing list. For questions about the track, send mail to the track coordinator (or post the question to the track mailing list once you join).

TRACK REGISTRATION



Organizations wishing to participate in any of the TAC 2009 tracks are invited to register online by May 31, 2009. Registration for a track does not commit you to participating in the track, but is helpful to know for planning. Late registration will be permitted only if resources allow. Any questions about conference participation may be sent to the TAC project manager: tac-manager@nist.gov.



    * Track Registration Form



WORKSHOP



The TAC 2009 workshop will be held November 16-17, 2009, in Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA, and is co-located with the meeting of the Eighteenth Text REtrieval Conference (TREC 2009). The TAC workshop is a forum both for presentation of results (including failure analyses and system comparisons), and for more lengthy system presentations describing techniques used, experiments run on the data, and other issues of interest to researchers in NLP. Track participants who want to give a presentation during the workshop will submit a 500-word abstract in September describing the experiments they performed. As there is a limited amount of time for oral presentations, the TAC advisory committee will use the abstracts to determine which participants are asked to speak and which will present in a poster session.

NooJ Conference 2012

June 14-16, 2012

Paris, France	 





INALCO/SEDYL and the Laboratoire de Sémio-Linguistique et Didactique (LASELDI) of the Université de Franche-Comté organize the NooJ 2012 International Conference in Paris, June 14-16, 2012. 

NooJ is a linguistic development environment that allows linguists to formalize several levels of linguistic phenomena: typography and spelling; lexicons of simple words, multiword units and discontinuous expressions; inflectional, derivational and productive morphology; local and structural syntax, transformational and semantic analysis and generation. For each of these levels NooJ provides linguists with one or more formal tools specifically designed to facilitate the description of each phenomenon, as well as parsing/development/debugging tools designed to be as computationally efficient as possible, from Finite-State to Turing machines. This approach distinguishes NooJ from other computational linguistic frameworks which provide a unique formalism. As a corpus processing tool, NooJ allows researchers in various social sciences to extract information from corpora by applying sophisticated queries based on concepts rather than word forms and build indices and concordances, add semantic annotations, perform statistical analyses on concepts, etc.

NooJ is freely available and linguistic modules can already be freely downloaded for over a dozen languages. See www.nooj4nlp.net for more information on NooJ.



The conference intends to



– give NooJ users and researchers in Linguistics and in Computational Linguistics the opportunity to meet and share their experience as developers, researchers and teachers; 

– present to NooJ users the latest linguistic resources and NLP applications developed for/with NooJ, its latest functionalities, as well as its future developments; 

– offer researchers and graduate students two tutorials (one basic and one advanced) to help them parse corpora and build NLP applications using NooJ. 

– provide the occasion to present and discover the recent developments of NooJ itself (v3).



Topics of interest 



– Typography; Spelling

– Morphology

– Linguistic resources; Lexical Analysis

– Local Syntax; Structural Syntax; Syntactic Parsing

– Transformational Analysis; Paraphrase Generation

– Semantic annotations; Semantic analysis 



Submission



Abstracts (up to 1 page, 400-600 words) in English containing the title of the paper, author(s)’s name, e-mail address and affiliation should be submitted to nooj2012@inalco.fr.

since ancient times; it boasts 22 mineral springs with water 

temperatures between 37-52 degree Celsius. Archaeological 

research has revealed that a town existed near the springs 

5000 years BC. Many years later Thracians, and after them 

Romans, settled around the warm springs. The Roman emperor 

Diocletian visited the town in 293 and built a fortified 

wall around it. The town was named Diocletianopol. Famous 

archaeological monuments such as:

- the Thracian Tomb of Kazanluk HYPERLINK

TRAVEL

Hissar is situated in the centre of Bulgaria, 40 km north of 

the second largest Bulgarian city, Plovdiv, and 160 km east 

of the capital, Sofia. Both the international airports of 

Sofia and Plovdiv can be used as arrival/departure points 

for RANLP-2013. Ryanair is now operating flights between 

London Stansted and Frankfurt/Hahn to Plovdiv two times per 

week. Sofia Airport is connected to Plovdiv via a motorway 

and it takes only 1 hour and 45 minutes to reach Hissar from 

Sofia. In addition to the regular public transport (trains 

and buses), the organisers will provide shuttle minibuses 

from/to Sofia and Plovdiv airports at an inexpensive rate.

We invite submissions to the First Workshop on Algorithms and Resources for Modelling of Dialects and Language Varieties. The workshop will be held in conjunction with EMNLP 2011 on July 31, in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. It will consist of one day of oral presentations and poster sessions.



Workshop URL: http://www.ofai.at/~dialects2011/



General Information



The currently prevailing statistical paradigm has made possible major achievements in many areas of natural language processing. But since the methods employed critically depend on the availability of large training corpora, the applicability of these methods is generally limited to major languages / standard varieties, to the exclusion of dialects or varieties that substantially differ from the standard.



The crucial obstacle is scarcity of data. Most important of all, substantial corpora of language varieties or dialects are rare. Moreover, authoritative orthographic conventions usually do not exist. As a result, the notation of written texts can vary widely and there are no obvious conventions for the annotation of speech corpora.



This situation calls for novel approaches, methods and techniques to overcome or circumvent the problem of data scarcity, but also to enhance and strengthen the standing that language varieties and dialects have in natural language processing technologies as well as in interaction technologies that build upon the former.



While there will be a clear focus on machine learning applied to the before mentioned problems, this workshop aims at gathering researchers with expertise in various disciplines.



Topics



* Machine learning algorithms operating in the regime of data scarcity

* Bootstrapping and active learning schemes for principled acquisition, annotation or generation of training data

* Methods to acquire resources by exploiting the proximity between varieties and standard language

* Issues of orthography and annotation

* Machine translation between language varieties or dialects

* Speech synthesis of dialects with limited corpora

* Interaction technologies dealing with social identity in speech and text

* Novel approaches transcending the paradigm of statistical modelling 



Progress in the above listed topics requires an interdisciplinary approach: machine learning, machine translation, speech synthesis, automatic speech recognition but also linguistics and interaction technologies will have to contribute. We invite researchers with a genuine interest in modelling of language varieties and the advancement of natural language processing in this area.



Important Dates



* Paper submission deadline: May 2, 2011

* Acceptance notification: May 30, 2011

* Camera-ready copy due: June 13, 2011

* Workshop meeting: July 31, 2011



All deadlines refer to 23:59 GMT-11 (Samoa time) on the indicated day.



Submissions



We invite high-quality submissions on original, unpublished work in areas relating to the aforementioned topics. Both significant theoretical advances and descriptions of successful practical systems involving processing or generation of language varieties are welcome. Submission of work that is only incremental in nature or describes minor progress is explicitly discouraged.



Two paper categories will be distinguished:



* Long papers are expected to report on contributions of lasting value and will be presented orally in the plenary session of the workshop. Submissions should not exceed a length of 9 pages, excluding references.



* Short papers are ideally suited for exciting new work that is not yet mature enough for a long paper, but has substantial merit. The work will be presented during the poster session and - depending on the type of work - a system demonstration can be given. The length of short papers is restricted to 4 pages, excluding references.



Reviewing will be double-blind, so please ensure your submission is properly anonymized. In particular, the paper should not reveal the authors' identities or include acknowledgments or references to project names, websites, software or such that might give away the identity.



Submissions should follow the two-column format of the ACL 2011 proceedings. The official style files can be obtained at http://www.acl2011.org/call.shtml. Submission is handled using the START system at



  https://www.softconf.com/emnlp/DIALECTS2011/ .



Papers must be uploaded until *May 2, 23:59 GMT-11*.



Policy regarding submission to multiple workshops/conferences: It is acceptable to submit the same paper to another workshop or conference. However, in this case we request that you inform the organizers in a separate e-mail in advance, such that we know the paper might be withdrawn. In addition, if you do decide to withdraw, we request that you notify us by May 26th, at the very latest.

Workshop on Semantic Spaces at the Intersection of NLP, Physics, and Cognitive Science



Part of ESSLLI 2019 (http://esslli2019.folli.info/)



August 5th - 9th 2019

Riga, Latvia



https://sites.google.com/view/semspace2019/home

AIMS AND SCOPE

Vector embeddings of word meanings have become a mainstream tool in large scale natural language processing tools. The use of vectors to represent meanings in semantic spaces or feature spaces is also employed in cognitive science. Unrelated to natural language and cognitive science, vectors and vector spaces have been extensively used as models of physical theories and especially the theory of quantum mechanics. Crucial similarities between the vector representations of quantum mechanics and those of natural language are exhibited via bicompact linear logic and compact closed categorical structures in natural language.



Exploiting the common ground provided by vector spaces, the workshop will bring together researchers working at the intersection of NLP, cognitive science, and physics, offering to them an appropriate forum for presenting their uniquely motivated work and ideas. The interplay between these three disciplines will foster theoretically motivated approaches to understanding how meanings of words interact with each other in sentences and discourse via grammatical types, how they are determined by input from the world, and how word and sentence meanings interact logically.



Topics of interests include (but are not restricted to):

Reasoning in semantic spaces

Compositionality in semantic spaces and conceptual spaces

Conceptual spaces in linguistics and natural language processing

Applications of quantum logic in natural language processing and cognitive science

Modelling functional words such as prepositions and relative pronouns in compositional distributional models of meaning

Diagrammatic reasoning for natural language processing and cognitive science

Modelling so-called ‘non-compositional’ phenomena such as metaphor

SCOPE AND TOPICS



The special session we propose here had two previous editions. The first edition was in 2011 as a workshop organized within the IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology that was held in Lyon from 22nd to 27th August 2011. In the first edition, ten papers were accepted. The second edition was in 2013 as a Special Session at ICAART 2013: 5th International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence. Since it was a special session, we just accepted seven papers plus a round table. In this second edition, we have as an invited speaker one of the most prestigious researchers in the field of Logic Programming: Verónica Dahl. We were very satisfied with the quality of the presentations and with the discussion generated in those two editions. In fact, the success of LAFLang 2011 and 2013 led us to propose again the organization of this special session. We think that PAAMS Conference fits very well the topic of LAFLang because this special session puts together the two main conference areas: agents and artificial intelligence.



LAFLang focuses on the common space delimited by three main areas: machine learning, agent technologies and formal language theory. The main goal of the special session is to promote interdisciplinarity among people working in such disciplines, boosting the interchange of knowledge and viewpoints between specialists. This interdisciplinary research can provide new models that may improve AI technologies.



Understanding human learning well enough to reproduce aspects of that learning behaviour in a computer system is a worthy scientific goal. One of the less understood learning capacities of humans is their ability to acquire a natural language. In order to better understand natural language acquisition, research in formal models of language learning, within the field of machine learning, has received significant attention. The theory of formal language theory is central to the field of machine learning, since the specific subfield of grammatical inference deals with the process of learning grammars and languages from data. 



The theory of formal languages was mainly originated from mathematics and generative linguistics as a tool for modelling and investigating syntax of natural languages, and then it played an important role in the field of computer science. While the first generation of formal languages was based on rewriting, a further development in this area has been the idea of several devices collaborating for achieving a common goal. Formal language theory has taken advantage of the idea of formalizing agent architectures where a hard task is distributed among several task-specific agents. In fact, non-standard formal language models have been proposed as grammatical models of agent systems. 



So, the areas of machine learning, agent technologies and formal languages are clearly related. Therefore we are interested in contributions on any interaction between those three research areas.



Topics include (but are not limited to):

* Agent systems modelling

* Grammatical models of agent systems

* Formal models of bio-inspired agent systems 

* Theoretical descriptions of languages based on agent systems

* Learning agents: Machine learning and Agent systems

* Applications of learning agents to natural language processing

* Applications of learning agents to human-computer interaction 

* Applications of learning agents to language evolution 

* Intelligent human-computer interaction

Submissions will be judged on appropriateness, clarity, originality/innovativeness, correctness/ soundness, meaningful comparison, thoroughness, significance, contributions to research resources, and replicability. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus two extra pages for references; final versions should take into account reviewers' comments. Papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. Decisions on presentation format will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings between long papers presented orally and as posters.



The long paper deadline is:

Wednesday February 20th, 2013



Short papers: ACL 2013 also solicits short papers. Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Characteristics of short papers include:



    A small, focused contribution

    Work in progress

    A negative result

    An opinion piece

    An interesting application nugget



Short papers will be presented in one or more oral or poster sessions, and will be given four (4) pages including references in the proceedings. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers presented orally and posters. Each short paper submission will be reviewed by at least two program committee members.



The deadline for short papers is

Sunday April 14th, 2013



Electronic Submission:

Submission is electronic, using the Softconf submission software (URL to be announced in subsequent versions of this call)



Format:

Long paper submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL 2013 proceedings without exceeding eight (8) pages of content plus two extra pages for references. Short paper submissions should also follow the two- column format of ACL 2013 proceedings, and should not exceed four (4) pages including references. We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word style files tailored for this year's conference.

BlackboxNLP 2019: Analyzing and interpreting neural networks for NLP -- ACL 2019 Workshop



ACL, Florence, Italy

Conference website: http://www.acl2019.org

Workshop website: https://blackboxnlp.github.io/

Submission deadline: April 19



====================================================================



Neural networks have rapidly become a central component in NLP systems in the last few years. The improvement in accuracy and performance brought by the introduction of neural networks has typically come at the cost of our understanding of the system: How do we assess what the representations and computations are that the network learns? The goal of this workshop is to bring together people who are attempting to peek inside the neural network black box, taking inspiration from machine learning, psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience. The topics of the workshop will include, but are not limited to:



- Applying analysis techniques from neuroscience to analyze high-dimensional vector representations (such as Haxby et al., 2001; Kriegeskorte, 2008) in artificial neural networks;

- Analyzing the network's response to strategically chosen inputs in order to infer the linguistic generalizations that the network has acquired (e.g., Linzen et al., 2016; Loula et al., 2018);

- Examining the performance of the network on simplified or formal languages (e.g., Hupkes et al., 2018; Lake et al., 2018);

- Proposing modifications to neural network architectures that can make them more interpretable (e.g., Palanki et al., 2017);

- Scaling up neural network analysis techniques developed in the connectionist literature in the 1990s (Elman, 1991);

- Testing whether interpretable information can be decoded from intermediate representations (e.g., Adi et al.,  2017; Chrupała et al., 2017; Hupkes et al., 2017);

- Translating insights on neural networks interpretation from the vision domain (e.g., Zeiler & Fergus, 2014) to language;

- Explaining model predictions (e.g., Lei et al., 2016; Alvarez-Melis & Jaakkola, 2017): What are ways to explain specific decisions made by neural networks?

- Adversarial examples in NLP (e.g., Ebrahimi et al., 2018; Belinkov & Bisk, 2018): How to generate them and how to evaluate their quality?

- Open-source tools for analyzing neural networks in NLP (e.g., Strobelt et al., 2018; Rikters, 2018).

- Evaluation of analysis results: How do we know that the analysis is valid? 



BlackboxNLP 2019 is the second BlackboxNLP workshop. The programme and proceedings of the previous edition, which was held at EMNLP 2018, can be found here: https://blackboxnlp.github.io/2018/.



================================================================



We call for two types of papers:



- Archival papers. These are papers reporting on completed, original and unpublished research, with maximum length of 8 pages + references. Papers shorter than this maximum are also welcome. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop and will be published in the workshop proceedings. They should report on obtained results rather than intended work. These papers will undergo double-blind peer-review, and should thus be anonymized.

- Extended abstracts. These may report on work in progress or may be cross submissions 

that have already appeared in a non-NLP venue. The extended abstracts are of maximum 

2 pages + references. These submissions are non-archival in order to allow 

submission to another venue. The selection will not be based on a double-blind 

review and thus submissions of this type need not be anonymized.



Submission information: 

- Submissions should follow the official ACL 2019 style guidelines. 

- Submissions should be made through the Sonftconf START system: https://www.softconf.com/acl2019/blackboxnlp.

=== Scope and Aim of the Workshop ===

The open access movement in scientific publishing and search engines like Google Scholar have made scientific articles more broadly accessible. During the last decade, the availability of scientific papers in full text has become more and more widespread thanks to the growing number of publications on online platforms such as ArXiv and CiteSeer. The efforts to provide articles in machine-readable formats and the rise of Open Access publishing have resulted in a number of standardized formats for scientific papers (such as NLM-JATS, TEI, DocBook), full-text datasets for research experiments (PubMed, JSTOR, etc.) and corpora (iSearch, etc.). At the same time, research in the field of Natural Language Processing have provided a number of open source tools for versatile text processing (e.g. NLTK, Mallet, OpenNLP, CoreNLP, Gate, CiteSpace). 



Scientific papers are highly structured texts and display specific properties related to their references but also argumentative and rhetorical structure. Recent research in this field has concentrated on the construction of ontologies for citations and scientific articles (e.g. CiTO, LinkedScience1) and studies of the distribution of references . However, up to now full-text mining efforts are rarely used to provide data for bibliometric analyses. While bibliometrics traditionally relies on the analysis of metadata of scientific papers (see e.g. a recent special issue on Combining Bibliometrics and Information Retrieval, Mayr & Scharnhorst, 2015), we will explore the ways full-text processing of scientific papers and linguistic analyses can play. With this workshop we like to discuss novel approaches and provide insights into scientific writing that can bring new perspectives to understand both the nature of citations and the nature of scientific articles. The possibility to enrich metadata by the full-text processing of papers offers new fields of application to bibliometrics studies.

Working with full text allows us to go beyond metadata used in bibliometrics. Full text offers a new field of investigation, where the major problems arise around the organization and structure of text, the extraction of information and its representation on the level of metadata. Furthermore, the study of contexts around in-text citations offers new perspectives related to the semantic dimension of citations. The analyses of citation contexts and the semantic categorization of publications will allow us to rethink co-citation networks, bibliographic coupling and other bibliometric techniques. 



The workshop aims to bring together researchers in bibliometrics and computational linguistics in order to study the ways bibliometrics can benefit from large-scale text analytics and sense mining of scientific papers, thus exploring the interdisciplinarity of Bibliometrics and Natural Language Processing. How can we enhance author network analysis and bibliometrics using data obtained by text analytics? What insights can NLP provide on the structure of scientific writing, on citation networks, and on in-text citation analysis?





=== Workshop Topics ===

Topics include (but are not limited to) the following:

- Linguistic modeling and discourse analysis for scientific texts

- User interfaces, text representations and visualizations

- Structure of scientific articles (discourse / argumentative / rhetorical / social)

- Scientific corpora and paper standards

- Act of citations, in-text citations and Content Citation Analysis

- Co-citation and bibliographic coupling

-Text enhanced bibliographic coupling

- Terminology extraction

SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS



The Second Workshop on Systems and Frameworks

for Computational Morphology (sfcm 2011)



http://sfcm2011.org/



Workshop date: Friday, August 26, 2011



Location: University of Zurich, Switzerland



Submission deadline: March 1, 2011



*********************************************************************



The Workshop on Systems and Frameworks for Computational Morphology

(sfcm) aims to bring together researchers and developers in the area

of computational morphology.  The focus of sfcm are actual, working

systems and frameworks based on linguistic principles and providing

linguistically motivated analyses and/or generation on the basis of

linguistic categories.



In 2011, sfcm will take place for the second time.  The proceedings of

sfcm 2009 were published by Springer-Verlag under the title ""State of

the Art in Computational Morphology.""  The proceedings of sfcm 2011

will again be published by Springer-Verlag.



From the point of view of computational linguistics, morphological

resources form the basis for all higher-level applications.  This is

especially true for languages with a rich morphology like German,

Finnish, or Polish.  A morphology component should thus be capable of

analyzing single wordforms as well as whole corpora.  For many

practical applications, not only morphological analysis, but also

generation is required, i.e., the production of surfaces corresponding

to specific categories.



Apart from uses in computational linguistics, there are numerous

practical applications that can benefit from morphological analysis

and/or generation or even require it, for example in text processing,

user interfaces, or information retrieval.  These applications have

specific requirements for morphological components, including

requirements from software engineering, such as programming interfaces

or robustness.



The workshop has three main goals:



    * To stimulate discussion among researchers and developers and to

      offer an up-to-date overview of available morphological systems

      for specific purposes.

    * To stimulate discussion among developers of general frameworks

      that can be used to implement morphological components for

      several languages.

    * To discuss aspects of evaluation of morphology systems and

      possible future competitions or tasks.





*Topics*



The topics of this workshop include technical aspects, applications,

and uses of systems and frameworks for computational morphology.

While purely theoretical submissions may be relevant, the focus of the

workshop is clearly on actual, working systems and prototypes.



sfcm 2009 focused on systems for a specific language (German).  The

main theme of sfcm 2011 are phenomena at the interface between

morphology and syntax (regardless of the language): Many practical

applications have to deal with texts, not just isolated word forms.

This requires to handle phenomena that cannot be easily classified as

either ""morphologic"" or ""syntactic.""  Examples of such phenomena are

clitics in Spanish, particle verbs in German, or compounds in English.



However, we also welcome submissions on other topics relevant to the

general topic of the workshop, i.e., systems and frameworks for

computational morphology.



Topics include, but are not limited to:



    * Approaches for handling phenomena at the interface between

      morphology and syntax.

    * Frameworks for developing morphological components.

    * Open-source tools and resources for morphology.

    * Descriptions of systems for analyzing and generating wordforms.

    * Morphological components for interactive use.

    * Use cases for morphological analysis and generation in applications.

    * Reports on actual uses of morphological analysis and generation

      in applications.

    * Methods and criteria for evaluating morphologic components with

      respect to performance, quality, and coverage.

    * Software engineering aspects: APIs, robustness, performance,

      hardware/software requirements, resource usage.

    * License models and legal aspects.



There will be opportunities for demonstrating systems.





*Submissions*



We invite researchers to submit full papers of up to 20 pages

(including references) or short papers of up to 10 pages.  Long papers

constitute an excellent opportunity to publish citable, in-depth

descriptions of systems and frameworks.  Submissions must be in

English.  Reviewing of papers will be double-blind by the members of

the program committee, and all submissions will receive several

independent reviews.  Papers submitted at review stage must not

contain the authors' names, affiliations, or any information that may

disclose the authors' identity.



Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their research

at the workshop as talk or as a poster.  When submitting a paper you

can indicate if you prefer giving a talk or showing a poster (however,

the chairs reserve the right to choose the most appropriate format).

You can also indicate if you would like to show a demo (strongly

encouraged!).  Accepted papers will be published by Springer-Verlag in

the printed workshop proceedings.



The papers must use the Springer LNCS format.  We recommend to use the

LaTeX2e format.  Please strictly follow the Springer LNCS format

guidelines.  Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format.

For paper submissions we use EasyChair; submission is now open, please

see

for details.



Please help us assigning your paper to the best qualified reviewers by

including the language(s) discussed in your paper with the keywords in

the ""Keywords"" field of the submission form.

of natural language because of its attractive formal properties and

its extended domain of locality. TAG has been studied extensively

in the last three decades with respect to mathematical properties

and computational applications, as well as its role in constructing

grammatical theories, new models of language processing and

applications.



This workshop, the latest in a series that has been running

successfully since 1990, aims at bringing together researchers

interested in various aspects of the TAG formalism including relations

to other grammar formalisms -- this is the reason for the ""+"" in

the workshop's name. In the past, interaction between such formalisms

has been productive, leading for example to the shared development

of broad-coverage grammars, transfer of parsing and machine learning

algorithms from one formalism to another and to new insights into

properties of different formalisms. Such related formalisms would

include minimalist syntax, categorial grammar, dependency grammars,

HPSG, LFG, and others which share with TAG general properties such

as lexicalization of syntactic structure, a simple notion of local

grammatical dependency, and a formal system strictly more powerful

than context-free but not fully context-sensitive.





Invited speakers:



* Uwe Moennich, University of Tuebingen

* Stuart Shieber, Harvard University



Topics:



We invite submissions on all aspects of TAG and related systems including

the following topics:



* syntactic and semantic theory;

Background and Goals

Growing interest in Chinese language processing is leading to the development of resources such as annotated corpora, word segmenters, part-of-speech taggers, and parsers. As more resources have become available recently, it is crucial to create a platform that allows easy exchange of information and data and the comparison of different approaches to various NLP tasks. The SIGHAN workshops provide a forum where the latest research in these areas can be shared.



This series of workshop is organized under the auspices of the Special Interest Group on Chinese Language Processing (SIGHAN) under the Association for Computational Linguistics. SIGHAN was established in 2001 to realize and promote the widespread interest in Chinese language processing.



Following the success of previous SIGHAN workshops, IJCNLP-08 in Hyderabad will provide yet another ideal opportunity to bring together again influential as well as aspiring researchers from Asia Pacific, and those from many others from Europe and USA, to deliberate and interact on a range of research issues.



Papers are invited on substantial, original and unpublished research on all aspects of Chinese language processing, including but not limited to:



    * word segmentation

    * part-of-speech tagging

    * parsing

    * lexical semantics

    * word sense disambiguation

    * lexicon acquisition

    * corpus development

    * discourse processing

    * generation

    * cross-lingual information retrieval

    * machine translation



SIGHAN has also featured its International Chinese Language Processing Bakeoffs, which attracted many research teams from all over the world to submit their word segmentation systems and named entity recognition systems for evaluation in the shared tasks, thus benchmarking for the two areas in the Chinese language processing community. The 4th bakeoff will be co-organised by SIGHAN, the Verifying Center on Chinese Language and Character Standards of the State Language Commission of PRC, and the ChineseLDC. Results from the bakeoff will be presented on the second half-day of the SIGHAN-6 Workshop. More information will follow in due course.



Submission Method



Papers should be written in English and may not exceed 8 pages (including all illustrations, references and appendices, and using 11pt for the main text). We strongly recommend the use of the LaTeX style files or MS Word document template provided by IJCNLP 2008, available at http://www.ijcnlp2008.org/callforpapers.htm. Since reviewing

It is based on the idea of a shared abstract syntax and mappings between the abstract syntax and concrete languages. GF grammars are bi-directional; however, they are particularly well suited for language generation.



What makes the development of GF application grammars rapid and flexible is the general-purpose GF resource grammar library which currently covers more than 30 languages implementing the same abstract syntax, a shared syntactic API.



Compiled GF grammars can be embedded in applications written in other programming languages. GF has a command interpreter and a batch compiler, as well as Haskell and C run-time systems for parsing and linearization. The C run-time system has Java and Python bindings, and it allows for probabilistic parsing as well. There are hundreds of GF users all over the world.



Among ongoing research projects, there are efforts to integrate GF with Universal Dependencies, FrameNet, Abstract Meaning Representation, and other syntactic and semantic models. Thus, the special theme for the 5th summer school: GF in a Full Stack of Language Technology.

In conjunction with ICSC 2019 (IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing)

Jan 30 - Feb 1, 2019, Newport Beach, California, USA





Overview 

------------ 



Internet users have become providers of information through social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and so forth. On the other side, organizations may benefit by integrating social network analysis, for instance, to understand employee innovative behavior, as, for instance, integrating social networks and the leader-member exchange perspectives. Still, networks models show how information sharing, models of social cohesion and mutual goals (i.e. values) make organization social capital.  In this context, Semantic Computing plays a chief role because of its potentiality to turn shapeless crowds information into social and digestible knowledge. 

Furthermore, recent developments in processing, storing, and sharing a huge amount of data become problematic due to the lack of new approaches, techniques, methods, algorithms, and technologies oriented to social networks, including theoretical notions and insufficient awareness on security, retrieval, networking, behavioral and social issues. 

The workshop, that will take place on Jan 30, 2019 - Feb 1, 2019, in conjunction with the 13th IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC2019), (http://www.ieee-icsc.org/) is a forum for researchers, industry practitioners and domain experts in the field of semantic computing, social networks, and social interactions and organisation sciences to exchange the latest advances in the state of the art and practice of semantic computing applications to the social network context.

OBJECTIVE



 Following the success of the first Workshop on Building and Using

 Comparable Corpora

 (http://www.limsi.fr/~pz/lrec2008-comparable-corpora/) at LREC 2008,

 this workshop aims to bring together language engineers as well as

 linguists interested in the constitution and use of comparable

 corpora, ranging from parallel to non-parallel corpora. In the larger

 context of the joint ACL-IJCNLP, this workshop aims to solicit

 contributions from researchers in different geographical regions, in

 order to highlight in particular the issues with comparable corpora

 across languages that are very different from each other, such as

 across Asian and European languages. Research in minority languages

 is also of particular interest.





MOTIVATION



 Research in comparable corpora has been motivated by two main reasons

 in the language engineering and the linguistics communities. In

 language engineering, it is chiefly motivated by the need to use

 comparable corpora as training data for statistical NLP applications

 such as statistical machine translation or cross-lingual retrieval.

 In linguistics, on the other hand, comparable corpora are of interest

 themselves in providing intra-linguistic discoveries and

 comparisons. It is generally accepted in both communities that

 comparable corpora are documents in one to many languages, that are

 comparable in content and form in various degrees and dimensions. It

 was pointed out that parallel corpora are at one end of the spectrum

 of comparability whereas quasi-comparable corpora are at the other

 end. We believe that the linguistic definitions and observations in

 comparable corpora can improve methods to mine such corpora for

 applications to statistical NLP. As such, it is of great interest to

 bring together builders and users of such corpora.



 Parallel corpora are a key resource as training data for statistical

 machine translation, and for building or extending bilingual lexicons

 and terminologies. However, beyond a few language pairs such as

 English-French or English-Chinese and a few contexts such as

 parliamentary debates or legal texts, they remain a scarce resource,

 despite the creation of automated methods to collect parallel corpora

 from the Web. Interests in non-parallel forms of comparable corpora

 in language engineering primarily ensued from the scarcity of

 parallel corpora. This has motivated research into the use of

 comparable corpora: pairs of monolingual corpora selected according

 to the same set of criteria, but in different languages or language

 varieties. Non-parallel yet comparable corpora overcome the two

 limitations of parallel corpora, since sources for original,

 monolingual texts are much more abundant than translated

 texts. However, because of their nature, mining translations in

 comparable corpora is much more challenging than in parallel

 corpora. What constitutes a good comparable corpus, for a given task

 or per se, also requires specific attention: while the definition of

 a parallel corpus is fairly straightforward, building a non-parallel

 corpus requires control over the selection of source texts in both

 languages.



 With the advent of online data, the potential for building and

 exploring comparable corpora is growing exponentially. Comparable

 documents in languages that are very different from each other pose

 special challenges as very often, the non-parallel-ness in sentences

 can result from cultural and political differences.

SCOPE 



Complexity has become an important concept in several scientific disciplines. There has been a lot of research on complexity and complex systems in natural sciences, economics and social sciences. Complexity has always been a central topic in area of formal languages and now also increasingly in natural language research. 



The main objective of this special session is to bring together researchers from different areas that have in common their interest on linguistic complexity, regarding formal and/or natural languages. We want to boost the interchange of knowledge and methods between specialists that have approached linguistic complexity from different viewpoints.  



In order to promote interdisciplinarity among researchers that are dealing with any type of linguistic (natural or formal) complexity, we are interested in contributions introducing methods, models, definitions and measures to assess complexity. We are interested in computational and formal approaches to linguistic complexity.



TOPICS OF THE SPECIAL SESSION. Topics include (but are not limited to):

• Complexity measures in formal languages

• Size complexity of formal languages

• Structural complexity of formal languages

• Descriptional complexity of formal languages

• Complexity of formal languages for modeling natural language

• Computational complexity of natural language

• Structural complexity of natural language

• Complexity in human natural language processing

• Complexity in automatic natural language processing

• Formal tools for measuring linguistic complexity

Shared Task Description: 



Tha Causality Detection task focuses on detecting if an object, an event or a chain of events is considered a cause for a prior event. This shared task's target is to determine whether a causality is associated with a quantified fact. An event is defined as the arising or emergence of a new object or context in regard to a previous situation. So the task will emphasize the detection of causality associated with transformation of financial objects embedded in quantified facts.





Participants should fill the registration short form to register to FinCausal.

Registration will result in subscription to the task's mailing list.

Participants submitting results commit themselves to writing a short system paper to be published in ACL proceedings.

===Introduction===



Recent recognition of Collaboratively Constructed Semantic Resources (CSRs) such 

as Wikipedia [1], Wiktionary [2], Linked Open Data [3], and other resources 

developed using crowdsourcing such as Games with a Purpose [4] and Mechanical 

Turk [5] has substantially contributed to the research in natural language 

processing (NLP). 



Researchers started to use such resources to substitute for or supplement 

conventional lexical semantic resources such as WordNet or linguistically 

annotated corpora in different NLP tasks. Another research direction is to 

utilize NLP techniques to enhance the collaboration process and its outcome. 

This improves the overall quality of the CSRs [6,7]. Overall, the emergence of 

CSRs has generated new challenges to the research field that are to be addressed 

in the proposed workshop. 



The preceding ""The People's Web meets NLP"" workshops at ACL-IJCNLP 2009 and 

COLING 2010 have successfully gathered researchers from different areas, and 

enabled an interdisciplinary exchange of research outcomes and ideas. Such 

collaboration has contributed to the creation of valuable semantic resources and 

tools based on CSRs, such as word sense alignments between WordNet, Wikipedia, 

and Wiktionary [8,9,10], folksonomy and named entity ontologies [11,12], 

multiword terms [13], ontological resources [14,15], annotated corpora [16], and 

Wikipedia and Wiktionary APIs.  



The obvious next step in this area is to intensify research that demonstrates 

the effectiveness of the resources mined from CSRs as listed above in a variety 

of NLP tasks. This is why the 3rd workshop ""The People's Web meets NLP"" will 

especially welcome submissions that utilize resources and tools for CSRs. We 

invite both long and short papers and especially encourage to show the benefit 

of CSRs in diverse NLP tasks, for example word sense disambiguation [17] and 

semantic role labeling [18], in addition to further exploration of various 

aspects of CSRs. We also welcome tutorial-like submissions on using the software 

for CSRs to facilitate their wide adoption by the NLP community.

===Topics===



Specific topics include but are not limited to:



* Using collaboratively constructed resources and the information mined from 

  them for NLP tasks (cf. Section ""References""), such as word sense 

  disambiguation, semantic role labeling, information retrieval, text 

  categorization, information extraction, question answering, etc.; 

* Mining social and collaborative content for constructing structured lexical 

  semantic resources, annotated corpora and the corresponding tools; 

* Analyzing the structure of collaboratively constructed resources related to 

  their use in NLP; 

* Computational linguistics studies of collaboratively constructed resources, 

  such as wiki-based platforms or folksonomies; 

* Structural and semantic interoperability of collaboratively constructed 

  resources with conventional semantic resources and between themselves; 

* Mining multilingual information from collaboratively constructed resources;

* Using special features of collaboratively constructed resources to create 

  novel resource types, for example revision-based corpora, simplified versions

  of resources, etc.; 

* Quality and reliability of collaboratively constructed lexical semantic 

  resources and annotated corpora; 

* Hands-on practical knowledge on utilization of CSR APIs and tools or designing 

  crowdsourcing procedures for high quality outcomes. 



Though the workshop welcomes any CSRs-related topics, preference will be given 

to submissions on CSRs' application to NLP tasks, which is the special interest 

of this workshop edition. Thereby, we encourage the participation of researchers 

with various backgrounds: from computational linguistics (e.g. parsing and 

discourse analysis) to NLP applications and other areas that might benefit from 

collaboratively constructed semantic resources. Given that we receive a 

sufficient number of tutorial-like submissions, a dedicated presentation session 

for those will be scheduled. 



Extended versions of the papers may be submitted in parallel for publication in 

an edited volume ""The People's Web Meets NLP: Collaboratively Constructed 

Language Resources."" The book will be published in fall - winter 2012 as part

of the Springer book series: ""Theory and Applications of Natural Language 

Processing"", E. Hovy, M. Johnson and G. Hirst (eds.). Please refer to the open 

call for contributions shown below:

CALL FOR PAPERS: 

Affect analysis refers to the set of techniques which identify and measure the ‘experience of an emotion’. This workshop focuses on analyzing affect in content including text, audio, images, and videos. All methods and models that measure affective responses to content are in the scope of the workshop.



We invite submissions on topics including - but not limited to - text and multimedia, multilingual analysis and understanding of affective content, applications of affect–based language processing, spoken vs. written language comparison, and analysis of online text content: both user generated and planned marketing communication.  Specific examples of fields of interests include (but are not limited to):



- Affect modeling in content

- Computational models for consumer behavior theories

- Psycho-linguistics, including stylometrics and typography

- Affect-aware text generation 

- Spoken and formal language comparison 

- Psycho-demographic profiling

- Measurement and evaluation of affective content 

- Modeling consumer’s affect reactions

- Affect lexica for online marketing communication

- Affective commonsense reasoning 

- Affective human-agent, -computer, and-robot interaction 

- Multimodal emotion recognition and sentiment analysis



We especially invite papers investigating multiple related themes, industry papers, and descriptions of running projects and ongoing work. 



PRE-PUBLISHED WORK

One big goal of this workshop is to get a multidisciplinary community together through this meeting. We invite pre-published/in-press work as a part of a short presentation and poster session to encourage discussions and introductions across communities. These submissions will not be re-published but a few selected papers will be accepted for posters and short presentations.



CALL FOR DATASETS AND RESOURCES

We also invite dataset papers which describe new data resources . Dataset paper submissions must comprise:



- The data itself -- organized as a single dataset or a group of datasets, and

- Metadata which describes data collection and processing methods, documentation of the structure and descriptive statistics about the content and quality of the dataset. 

- Authors should describe potential uses and applications of the dataset, but any sophisticated analysis can be a regular paper submission.  



Submissions should be made via EasyChair and must follow the formatting guidelines for AAAI-2018 (use the AAAI Author Kit). All submissions must be anonymous and conform to AAAI standards for double-blind review.

This workshop invites a broad spectrum of work in the intersection between computational linguistics and social science. All submissions will be presented as posters, and active discussion of preliminary and ongoing work are especially encouraged. Topics include, but are not limited to:



	* Inferring social relations (e.g., power dynamics, stance, accommodation) from conversation and other linguistic behavior

	* Automatic extraction of international relations event data from news 

	* Inference of author and speaker properties (geography, age, gender, etc) from text and speech

	* Measuring and tracking political ideology in text, including the framing and positioning of ideological content

	* Understanding the political system, including public opinion, legislative and judicial processes, and popular unrest

	* Relating text datasets to author social networks: for example, predicting social ties from text, or smoothing textual topics over network structure

	* Tracking language change over time, space, and communities

	* Measuring linguistic influence

	* Computational analysis of literary and historical corpora

	* Tracking the flow of information, ideas, and sentiment through social networks, include information cascades

	* Position papers that draw implications from social science theory (sociology, political science, sociolinguistics, economics) for language technology

	* New applications of language technology to social science research



We especially welcome submissions with the potential to increase engagement between NLP researchers and social scientists, and which will help to build a community interested in language technologies and computational social science.  Submissions should be no more than four pages long in the 2014 ACL format, excluding references; review will be double-blind.  At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to participate in the workshop to present the poster.



Archival policy:  On acceptance, authors will have the option of either the paper or just the abstract being included in the workshop proceedings.  Independent of the preferred archival option, the submission and reviewing process will be identical.
