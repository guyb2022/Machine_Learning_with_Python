Submission Deadline: 1 August 2017



IEEE Access invites manuscript submissions in the area of Advanced Signal Processing Methods in Medical Imaging.



Medical Imaging is a technique to create visual representations of the interior of the body, with the aim of making accurate diagnosis and optimized treatments. Many medical imaging techniques are widely used to produce images, such as computer tomography (CT), ultrasound (US), positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/functional MRI (fMRI).



Manual interpretation and analysis of medical images is tedious and prone to error, causing overlooked, slight lesions that occasionally result in misdiagnosis. It is critical to develop advanced signal processing methods for a wide range of low-level (image reconstruction, contrast enhancement, image segmentation, etc.) and high-level applications (interpretation, classification, and grading of image findings in diagnoses, and the planning, monitoring, and evaluation of treatment) in medical imaging for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment. These applications need novel, advanced techniques in the areas of, but not limited to, computer vision, artificial intelligence/machine learning/pattern recognition, and evolution algorithm and optimization.



This Special Section in IEEE Access aims to collect a diverse and complementary set of articles that demonstrate new developments and applications of advanced signal processing in medical imaging. It will help both physicians and radiologists in the image interpretation, and help technicians to exchange the latest technical progresses. These topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following:

2019 IEEE Conference on Wireless Sensors (ICWiSe)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 



The IEEE Conference on Wireless Sensors (ICWiSE) 2019 will be held in Penang Island, Malaysia on 19 – 21 November 2019. The conference provides an excellent opportunity to share and exchange technologies and applications in the area of wireless sensors for professionals, engineers, academics and industrial people worldwide. ICWiSE 2019 is sponsored by IEEE Computer Society Malaysia. ICWiSE entered its 6th year, the previous conferences were successfully organized in Kuching (ICWiSe 2013), Kuala Lumpur (ICWiSe 2014) and Malacca (2015), Langkawi (2016), Miri (2017) and Langkawi (2018).



Penang is a state in northwest Malaysia comprising mainland Seberang Perai and Penang Island. On the island, the state capital of George Town is home to landmarks such as colonial Fort Cornwallis, the ornate Chinese clan house Khoo Kongsi and the Kapitan Keling Mosque, all testaments to centuries of foreign influence. To the west, a funicular ascends Penang Hill, with its trails, flower gardens and panoramic views.



Penang is a world renowned exotic holiday destination – was known, once upon a time, as Pulau Pinang or the “Isle of the Betel Nut”. Listed as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site in 2008, this virgin paradise has no shortage of cultural sights and natural scenery. Nicknamed the Pearl of the Orient, Penang is famous for its soft sandy beaches and is fondly regarded as the food capital of Malaysia. Some of the most interesting sites of Penang include the sandy beaches of Tanjung Bungah, the landscape from the summit of Penang Hill and the vipers in the Snake Temple. The quaint nooks and crannies of Georgetown and the Tropical Spice Garden – the only spice garden in South East Asia – as well as Penang’s many flea markets, pasar malams’, KOMTAR and modern shopping malls also merit a visit.

LOCATION



Praha (Prague)--also called The City of a Hundred Spires or The Heart of

Europe--is situated in the very centre of Bohemia on the banks of the river

Vltava. There live more than 1.2 million people in the metropolitan area.

Thus, Praha is considered the centre of science, higher education, culture,

economy and authorities.



The city is divided into ten districts. Each of them offers its own

charming atmosphere predicated upon its rich history.  A good example can

be the Jewish Quarter (Josefov) known especially for the legend of Golem

and famous writer Franz Kafka. Then, walking the Parizska street (said to

be the most luxurious street in the city), there is the Old Town Square.

One of the most important squares of the city renowned for the rare Prague

Astronomical Clock (Orloj), number of galleries, Bethlehem Chapel and

a monument of religious reformer Jan Hus.



The next place of interest can be found in the area of the New Town. The

Wenceslas square with the monument of St. Wenceslas, the patron saint of

the Czech state, is the longest square of the republic. Its capacity is

fully used by various shops, restaurants, clubs and street artists. Also

the renaissance revival-styled building of National Museum, which is now

under reconstruction, is situated on the upper end of the square.



Modern art and architecture together with technical mastery demonstration

are represented by the Zizkov Television Tower, the Dancing House (Fred and

Ginger Building) or the Stefanik's Observatory on the Petrin hill located

in the neighbourhood of the quarter Hradcany. Also Krizik's light fountain

or Industrial Palace in the area of the Holesovice Showground are worth

seeing.



However, the dominant feature of the skyline is still created by the Prague

Castle and the Gothic St. Vitus Cathedral spires. The Golden Lane heading

down to the Lesser Town shows the tiny and colorful medieval houses.  There

are many bridges connecting the banks of the Vltava River. 



However, only one of them is well known in the whole world--the Charles

bridge. Czech King and Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV promoted its

construction in the 14th century. The bridge is 520 metres long and stands

for a connection between the Lesser Town and the Old Town. It was built in

the Gothic style as well as the St. Vitus Cathedral.



Charles IV was also the founder of the University, which now proudly bears

his name--The Charles University. It is one the world's oldest universities

and with 17 faculties, 3 institutes, 6 centres of teaching, research and

development it is also the largest and best rated university in the Czech

Republic. The students can choose some of the 642 courses within 300 of

accredited degree programmes in the field of medicine, law, theology,

pharmacy, arts, science, mathematics and physics, education, social

sciences, physical education and sports, and humanities.



We are justifiably very proud of the fact that the campus of the Charles

University is going to host the TSD2017 conference.

At that time in 2003, the ability to achieve recognition of distant speech voice commands, deep learning for object detection, as well as fully autonomous driving had not been regarded as an industrial reality for almost 10 years later. Now, with rapid advancements by diverse researchers worldwide, these domains have working realizations, and so the next main challenge is the integration of them towards more human friendly and society friendly automated systems. In this next workshop to take place in Nagoya in 2018, we will re-focus on the technologies of data analytics in speech/audio, computer vision and intelligent vehicle advancements under the perspectives of human harmonizing systems. The workshop organization will include inviting three distinctive keynote speakers from speech, vision and vehicle areas. We also invite stakeholders from industry, government for an open discussion/engaging panel discussion with researchers on the future deployment of autonomous and intelligent systems. As in previous workshops, extended articles in the selected presentations will be included in the next volume of the De Gruyter Book series ""DSP, human-to-vehicle interfaces, driver behavior, and safety."" The Organizing Committee looks forward to seeing you in Nagoya, and contributing your thoughts and expertise as signal processing research advances for next generation vehicle/driver systems.

Scope and Motivation



In recent years we have seen a growing international interest in research and development in OWC. Traditionally, OWC relies on high power solid state lasers or diode lasers for medium to long range applications. Recently we have seen remarkable advances in semiconductor sources such as light emitting diodes (LEDs) in visible light and ultraviolet wavelengths, multi-array light sources and detectors, tracking and steering. These advances provide huge potentials for short/medium range wireless communication applications at low power and low cost. This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry working in emerging visible light communications (VLC) and ultraviolet communications (UVC) as well as the traditional wireless infrared communications (IRC) to present, share and discuss their latest research findings.

SCOPE:



The focus of this special issue is on distributed information acquisition, estimation, and adaptive learning for security and privacy in the context of networked cyber-physical systems (CPSs) which are engineering systems with integrated computational and communication capabilities that interact with humans through cyber space. The CPSs have recently emerged in several practical applications of engineering importance including aerospace, industrial/manufacturing process control, multimedia networks, transportation systems, power grids, and medical systems. The CPSs typically consist of both wireless and wired sensor/agent networks with different capacity/reliability levels where the emphasis is on real-time operations, and performing distributed,secure, and optimal sensing/processing is the key concern. To satisfy these requirements of the CPSs, it is of paramount importance to design innovative “Signal Processing” tools to provide unprecedented performance and resource utilization efficiency.



A significant challenge for implementation of signal processing solutions in CPSs is the difficulty of acquiring data from geo- graphically distributed observation nodes and storing/processing the aggregated data at the fusion center (FC). As such, there has been a recent surge of interest in development of distributed and collaborative signal processing technologies where adaptation, estimation, and/or control are performed locally and communication is limited to local neighborhoods. Distributed

signal processing over networked CPSs, however, raise significant privacy and security concerns as local observations are being shared by neighboring nodes in a collaborative and iterative fashion. On one hand, applications of CPSs are severely safety critical where potential cyber and physical attacks by adversaries on signal processing modules could lead to a variety of severe consequences including customer information leakage, destruction of infrastructures, and endangering human lives. On the other hand, the need for cooperation be- tween neighboring nodes makes it imperative to prevent the disclosure of sensitive local information during distributed information fusion step. At the same time, efficient usage of available resources (communication, computation, bandwidth, and energy) is a prerequisite for productive operation of the CPSs. To accommodate these critical aspects of CPSs, it is of great practical importance and theoretical significance to develop advanced “Secure and Privacy Preserving Distributed Signal Processing” solutions.



The spirit and wide scope of distributed signal processing in revolutionized CPSs calls for novel and innovative techniques beyond conventional approaches to provide precise guarantees on security and privacy of CPSs. The objective of this special issue is to further advance recent developments of distributed signal processing to practical aspects of CPSs for real-time processing and monitoring of the underlying system in a secure and privacy preserving manner while avoiding degradation of

the processing performance and preserving the valuable resources. To provide a systematic base for future advancements of CPSs, this special issue aims to provide a research venue to investigate distributed signal processing techniques with adaptation, cooperation, and learning capabilities which are secure against cyber-attacks and protected against privacy leaks. The emphasis of this special issue is on distributed/network aspects of security and privacy in CPSs. Papers with

primary emphasis on forensics and security will be redirected to IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (TIFS). Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:



-Security and Privacy of distributed signal processing in networked CPSs.

-Distributed and secure detection, estimation, and information fusion.

-Security and privacy of consensus and diffusive strategies in networked systems.

-Secure and privacy preserving distributed adaptation and learning.

-Security and privacy of distributed sensor resource management in networked systems.

-Distributed event-based estimation/control in networked CPSs.

-Detection and identification of potential attacks on distributed signal processing mechanisms.

-Application domains including but not limited to, smart grids, camera networks, multimedia network, and vehicular networks.

Newly developed Optical fibers and amplifiers allow direct transmission of high-speed signals over transcontinental distances without the need for electronic regeneration. Optical fibers find new applications in data processing. The impact of fiber materials, devices and systems on communications in the coming decades will create an abundance of primary literature and the need for up-to-date reviews.
  
  This journal will give significant developments and in-depth surveys in the fields of fiber and integrated optics. This journal will be unique in bridging the major disciplines relevant to optical fibers and electro-optical devices. This results in a balanced presentation of basic research, system applications and economics. For more than a decade, Fiber and Optics has been a valuable forum for scientists, engineers, manufacturers and the business community to exchange and discuss techno-economic advances in the field. This will help in explaining the subject of optoelectronic devices and their use in integrated optics and fiber optic systems. The approach taken is to emphasize the physics that how devices work and how they can be (and have been) used in various applications as the field of optoelectronics has progressed from microphotonics to nanophotonics.Topics of interest include but are not limited to, the followingTera-hertz sources , detection & Tera-Hertz propagation.

Contact: radu.timofte [at] vision.ee.ethz.ch





Scope





Image manipulation is a key computer vision tasks, aiming at the restoration of degraded image content, the filling in of missing information, or the needed transformation and/or manipulation to achieve a desired target (with respect to perceptual quality, contents, or performance of apps working on such images). Recent years have witnessed an increased interest from the vision and graphics communities in these fundamental topics of research. Not only has there been a constantly growing flow of related papers, but also substantial progress has been achieved.



Each step forward eases the use of images by people or computers for the fulfillment of further tasks, as image manipulation serves as an important frontend. Not surprisingly then, there is an ever growing range of applications in fields such as surveillance, the automotive industry, electronics, remote sensing, or medical image analysis etc. The emergence and ubiquitous use of mobile and wearable devices offer another fertile ground for additional applications and faster methods.



This workshop aims to provide an overview of the new trends and advances in those areas. Moreover, it will offer an opportunity for academic and industrial attendees to interact and explore collaborations.



This workshop builds upon the success of the Perceptual Image Restoration and Manipulation (PIRM) workshop at ECCV 2018 , the workshop and Challenge on Learned Image Compression (CLIC) editions at CVPR 2018 and CVPR 2019 and the New Trends in Image Restoration and Enhancement (NTIRE) editions: at CVPR 2017 , 2018 and 2019 and at ACCV 2016. Moreover, it relies on the people associated with the PIRM, CLIC, and NTIRE events such as organizers, PC members, distinguished speakers, authors of published papers, challenge participants and winning teams.





Topics



Papers addressing topics related to image/video manipulation, restoration and enhancement are invited. The topics include, but are not limited to:



●    Image-to-image translation

●    Video-to-video translation

●    Image/video manipulation

●    Perceptual manipulation

★★DALIAN, CHINA ★★

The impression Dalian gives to the world is of a city of lawns, squares, fountains and gardens. This is all thanks to the former mayor of the city, Bo Xilai, who initiated a 'Green Storm' - a widespread environmental campaign which brought numerous green squares, forest parks and seaside scenic spots to the city. People say it is 'A City Built in Gardens'. Running from downtown there is a 40-kilometer (25-mile) road known as Binhai Lu winding along the coastline, northeast to southwest. This coastal area is a paradise for beach vacationers. The famous scenic spots of Bangchuidao Scenic Area, Tiger Beach Ocean Park, Jinshitan Scenic Area, Dalian Forest Zoo and Xinghai Square are scattered around this region. In addition to the stunning cliffs and scenic parks, numerous places along the coastline are good for beach resort visitors and water sports lovers. Meanwhile, you can sample the authentic Dalian-style seafood in a fisherman's house at an incredibly low price. Besides, there is a large entertainment park - Discoveryland Theme Park, inside Jinshitan Scenic Area, where you can feel the excitement of adventures.

in conjunction with CVPR 2020



Website: http://www.compression.cc/





Introduction



Our workshop aims to gather publications which will advance the field of image and video compression using state of the art machine learning and computer vision techniques. Even with the long history of signal-processing oriented compression, taking new approaches to image processing have great potential, due to the proliferation of high-resolution cell-phone images and special hardware (e.g., GPUs and mobile AI accelerators). The potential in this area has already been demonstrated using recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and adversarial learning, many of these matching the best image-compression standards when measured on perceptual metrics. As such, we are interested in the various techniques associated with this class of methods. Broadly speaking, we would like to encourage the development of novel encoder/decoder architectures, novel ways to control information flow between the encoder and the decoder, novel optimization objectives for improved perceptual quality and learn how to quantize (or learn to quantize) better. 





Challenge Tracks



There are two challenge tracks. In the low bit-rate track, images need to be compressed to below 0.15 bits per pixel (bpp). This is the same task as in previous years, which allows us to measure progress over the years. As a first step towards video compression, this year also includes a P-frame track. Here, video P-frames need to be predicted from a previous frame.



Low-rate compression



For the low bit-rate track (which is similar to the one we ran at CLIC 2018), contestants will be asked to compress the entire dataset to 0.15 bpp or smaller. The winners of the competition will be chosen based human perceptual rating task and will be asked to give a short talk at the CLIC workshop. PSNR and MS-SSIM will be evaluated but not considered for prizes. We will provide last year’s professional and mobile datasets (all splits) as the training data for this challenge track. A new test set will be generated for this year and released during the test phase. 





P-frame compression



The P-frame challenge will require entrants to compress a video frame conditioned on the previous image frame. Instead of splitting the dataset into training and test sets, in this track the entire dataset is released before the test phase. To discourage overfitting, the model size is added to the compressed dataset size and the sum cannot exceed a target bit-rate. That is, participants should try to minimize both the dataset size and the model size. The winner will be determined based on MS-SSIM.





Regular Paper Track



We will have a short (4 pages) regular paper track, which allows participants to share research ideas related to image compression. In addition to the paper, we will host a poster session during which authors will be able to discuss their work in more detail.



We encourage exploratory research which shows promising results in:



    Lossy image compression

    Quantization (learning to quantize; dealing with quantization in optimization)

    Entropy minimization

    Image super-resolution for compression

    Deblurring

    Compression artifact removal

    Inpainting (and compression by inpainting)

    Generative adversarial networks

    Perceptual metrics optimization and their applications to compression



And in particular, how these topics can improve image compression.





Challenge Paper Track



The challenge task participants are asked to submit a short paper (up to 4 pages) detailing the algorithms which they submitted as part of the challenge.

★About SAGC

Space-air-ground computing, as an integration of satellite systems, aerial networks, terrestrial communications, and Cloud computing has been becoming an emerging computing architecture and attracted intensive research interest.

With the global connectivity services/applications needs to be accommodated, such as ubiquitous communication, smart transportation, smart city, maritime surveillance, and disaster rescue, the terrestrial networks and computing alone cannot meet the needs in an effective and efficient manner. Space-air-ground computing, as an integration of satellite systems, aerial networks, terrestrial communications, and Cloud computing has been becoming an emerging computing architecture and attracted intensive research interest.

Hence, the IEEE International Conference on Space-Air-Ground Computing aims to become a prime international forum for both researchers and industry practitioners to exchange the latest fundamental advances in state of the art and practice of space-air-ground computing in the field of Computer Science and Electronic Engineers.

With the proliferation of many innovative data communications services such as social networks, cloud computing, location-based service, and Internet of Things, security and privacy issues become more and more demanding and challenging. In addition, wireless physical layer secrecy has attracted much attention in recent years due to the broadcast nature of the wireless medium and its inherent vulnerability to eavesdropping. While most workshops and symposiums on physical layer secrecy focus on the information-theoretic aspect, we look specifically at the signal processing aspects of secure physical layer communications. 

This workshop aims to bring together academics and industry professionals in the signal processing area as well to practitioners and engineers working on the security and privacy aspects of data communications and computer networks. This workshop will also provide a forum to present and discuss emerging ideas, progresses and trends in this highly challenging research field. Accordingly, we invite contributions that apply these signal processing approaches to more advanced wired and wireless systems, such as OFDM systems, cognitive radio, multi-hop networks etc. We also welcome novel research on side-channels and covert channels, where approaches from signal processing are used to strengthen/weaken the security of embedded devices. This will draw interest from researchers that wish to pursue the topic further in these new directions, facilitating scientific cross-fertilization. 





***PAPER FORMAT***

All papers must represent original and unpublished work that is not currently under review. Papers should not exceed 6 pages in length. Each submitted paper must conform to the IEEE format and submission guidelines. Submissions will be evaluated according to the relevance and originality of the work and to their ability to generate discussions between the participants of the workshop.

The revision process is double-blind. So please remove the authors' names from the pdf file when submitting your paper.





***INDEXING***

Accepted papers will be published by the IEEE Conference Publishing Services (CPS) and will be submitted to the IEEE-Xplore and the IEEE Computer Society (CSDL) digital libraries. The proceedings are also submitted for indexing through SCOPUS, IEE INSPEC, EI (Compendex),Thomson ISI, and other indexing services.





***RELATED TOPICS***

Topics of interest for articles include (but are not limited to) signal processing, security and privacy for:

SiPML will be held in University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium on November 7-9 , 2019, in conjunction with the main conference 14th International Conference on P2P, Parallel, Grid, Cloud and Internet Computing (3PGCIC 2019).

The aim of the workshop is to contribute to the cross-fertilization between the research on Machine Learning (ML) methods and their application to Signal Processing (SP) to initiate collaboration between these areas. ML usually plays an important role in the transition from data storage to decision systems based on large databases of signals such as the obtained from sensor networks, internet services, or communication systems. These systems imply developing both computational solutions and novel models. Signals from real-world systems are usually complex such as speech, music, bio-medical, and multimedia, among others.

SiPML will be held in Open University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain on November 8-10, 2017, in conjunction with the main conference 12th International Conference on P2P, Parallel, Grid, Cloud and Internet Computing (3PGCIC 2017).



The aim of the workshop is to contribute to the cross-fertilization between the research on Machine Learning (ML) methods and their application to Signal Processing (SP) to initiate collaboration between these areas. ML usually plays an important role in the transition from data storage to decision systems based on large databases of signals such as the obtained from sensor networks, internet services, or communication systems. These systems imply developing both computational solutions and novel models. Signals from real-world systems are usually complex such as speech, music, bio-medical, and multimedia, among others.

SiPML will be held in Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan on Octorber 27-29, 2018, in conjunction with the main conference 13th International Conference on P2P, Parallel, Grid, Cloud and Internet Computing (3PGCIC 2018).

The aim of the workshop is to contribute to the cross-fertilization between the research on Machine Learning (ML) methods and their application to Signal Processing (SP) to initiate collaboration between these areas. ML usually plays an important role in the transition from data storage to decision systems based on large databases of signals such as the obtained from sensor networks, internet services, or communication systems. These systems imply developing both computational solutions and novel models. Signals from real-world systems are usually complex such as speech, music, bio-medical, and multimedia, among others.

A body sensor network (BSN) connects sensors and devices that are placed around the human body or in personal clothing to collect physiological data. Different sensor technologies are used to collect this data, like physiological sensors (e.g., EEG, ECG, electrodermal activity, and skin conductance) and other non-intrusive sensors and devices (e.g., imaging cameras, Leap Motion, and Kinect). The collected data must be analyzed using intelligent methods in order to be usable in a variety of applications such as ambient assisted living, health monitoring, rehabilitation, sports, emotion-aware intelligent systems, and gaming.



Current research is interdisciplinary in nature, reflecting a combination of concepts and methods that often span several areas of electrical engineering, mathematics, health sciences, and other scientific disciplines. In these areas of application, the use of computational intelligence methods to enhance the efficiency and quality of results is very important. Contributions covering neural networks, bioinspired methods, and other computational intelligence methods are welcomed.



This Special Issue invites contributions that address (i) sensing technologies and issues and (ii) computational intelligence techniques of relevance to tackle the challenges above. In particular, submitted papers should clearly show novel contributions and innovative applications covering but not limited to any of the following topics:



ECG, EEG, and electrodermal activity sensor systems;

Sensor data pre-processing, noise filtering, and calibration concepts for physiological signals;

Electrical circuits and devices for wearable electronics;

Deep learning and bioinspired algorithms for a better understanding of BSN-collected physiological signals;

Applications in BSNs for human activity recognition, sport monitoring, emotion recognition, and health care.

Such devices are not anymore used for personal communication only, but also for a variety of other applications, ranging from accessing the Internet, storing personal data, making payments, and gaining access to restricted services or areas.



With the rise of the Internet of Things, a growth trend similar to the one characterizing mobile devices in the recent past is now observed for wearable devices such as smartwatch and activity trackers, that is, smart electronic devices equipped with micro-controllers which can be incorporated into clothing or worn on the body as implants or accessories.



Given the types of data must such devices can capture, process, and store, proper secure mechanisms are needed to avoid potentially harmful threats related to security and privacy loss. It is therefore of paramount importance to design workable and effective solutions to implement automatic recognition systems within mobile and wearable devices, with biometric systems certainly representing the most interesting alternative to achieve this goal.



The present workshop will highlight the recent developments in the evolving areas of mobile and wearable biometric recognition systems. We invite submissions from all areas of computer science and pattern recognition relevant for, or applied to, mobile and wearable biometric recognition.

-Physical biometrics (fingerprint, face, iris, vein, etc.)

-Behavioral biometrics (signature, keystroke, gait, etc.)

-Cognitive biometrics (ECG, PPG, EDA, EEG, etc.)

-Attacks at biometric systems

-Biometric template protection schemes

-Multibiometric recognition systems

-Machine Learning with limited computational resources

-User interface design

-Database collection

Aim of the Conference

----------------------------

The automatic analysis of images and signals in medicine, biotechnology, System Biology, chemistry, biometry, drug discovery and information robots is a challenging and demanding field. Signal-producing procedures by microscopes, spectrometers and other sensors have found their way into wide fields of medicine, biotechnology, economy and environmental analysis. With this arises the problem of the automatic mass analysis of signal information. Signal-interpreting systems which generate automatically

the desired target statements from the signals are therefore of compelling necessity. The continuation of mass analyses on the basis of the classical procedures leads to investments of proportions that are not feasible. New procedures and system architectures are therefore required. The scope of conference is to bring together researcher, praticioners, and industry people who are dealing with mass analysis of images and signals to present and discuss recent research in these fields.



The goals of this conference are to:

­	provide a forum for identifying important contributions and opportunities for research on mass data analysis on microscopic images,

­	promote the systematic study of how to apply automatic image analysis and interpretation procedures to that field

­	show case applications of mass data analysis in biology, medicine, and chemistry.



Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

 

•	Applications in Medicine, r/g/b Biotechnology, Food Industries and Dietetics, Biometry and Agriculture

•	Techniques and developments of signal and image producing procedures

•	Object matching and object tracking in microscopic and video microscopic images

•	1D, 2D and 3D shape analysis and description

•	1D, 2D and 3D feature extraction of texture, structure and location

•	Algorithms for 1D, 2D and 3D signal analysis and interpretation

•	Image segmentation algorithms

•	Parallelization of image analysis and interpretation algorithms

•	Semantic tagging of microscopic images

•	Applications in medicine, biotechnology, chemistry and others

•	Applications in crystallography

•	Applications in proteomics

•	Applications in 2D and 3D cell images analysis

•	Image Acquisition procedures for mass data analysis

•	Methods and solutions for biometrical systems (Face-, Iris and Fingerprint Recognition)

•	Recognition methods for moving objects (face, iris, body)

•	Methods for data encryption (e.g. crypotographic methods, watermarking)

-------------

S-CUBE 2018, the 9th International Conference on Sensor Systems and Software, provides an ideal venue to disseminate state-of-the-art work in the areas of system development and software support for wireless sensor network-based systems.



Wireless sensor networks are enabling innovative and interesting applications ranging from smart-homes and smart-cities to precision agriculture and advanced healthcare. The widespread acceptance of these new services, however, can be improved by the definition of new protocols, programming languages, frameworks, and architectures that can not only simplify the software development of wireless sensor networks, but that can also facilitate their system design, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance. Tackling these challenges requires contributions from many fields such as embedded systems, distributed systems, software engineering, semantic web, real-time data acquisition and data fusion, wireless protocols and system security.



The aim of the conference is to create a forum in which researchers from academia and industry, practitioners, business leaders, intellectual property experts, and venture capitalists may work together in order to compare and debate different innovative solutions. The conference will feature a highly selective technical program consisting of regular research papers, short papers, posters, and demos.

Such methods have been playing a significant role also in the electric vehicle (EV) sector, where they have been used, for example, for battery state estimation and management, smart charging, and fault diagnosis. Along with a positive impact on the environment and the society, the high penetration of EVs expected in the next years will also pose new challenges for our cities and the existing infrastructures. In this scenario, Machine-Learning and Signal Processing algorithms will play a fundamental role. Advanced algorithms are required for managing the EV internal operation and services, such as energy management, battery and driver state monitoring, but also for their integration within our cities (e.g., in pedestrian warning systems), and the interaction with the power grid (e.g., in Vehicle-to-Grid interaction, and in coordinated vehicle charging).



The aim of this session is thus to promote a forum where scientists and practitioners in the industry can discuss the most recent advancements in the application of Machine-Learning and Signal Processing techniques to the management of EVs and their interaction with the existing infrastructures.

GENERAL INFORMATION:



Within the framework of the 2018 41st International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP - http://tsp.vutbr.cz) held during July 4-6, 2018, Athens, Greece, prospective Organizers are invited to submit proposals for Workshops and Special Sessions at TSP 2018 Conference. Proposals are due through the form available at http://tsp.vutbr.cz/?page_id=3492 by March 5, 2018 (hard deadline). The TSP Conference serves as a premier annual international forum to promote the exchange of the latest advances in telecommunication technology and signal processing. The aim of the Conference is to bring together both novice and experienced scientists, developers, and specialists, to meet new colleagues, collect new ideas, and establish new cooperation between research groups from universities, research centers, and private sectors from the whole Europe, America, Asia, Australia, and Africa.



For a Workshop and Special Session proposal to be considered for acceptance at TSP 2018 Conference, the proposed topic needs to be an emerging area in telecommunications or signal processing. The topic should be timely and significantly important to the technical audience, and the speakers need to convey compelling information about the topic. The proposals will be evaluated by the ability to introduce the area to large telecommunications and signal processing community, further develop the area, and help establishing a larger research community beyond the area.



Each Workshop and Special Session will be approx. 90 minutes long and will usually consist of 5 oral presentations, however, in case of larger interest the Workshop or Special Session will be divided to more parts. Other formats may be possible, including panel discussions, demos, or poster presentations.



The Organizer’s role is to invite the speakers, help with reviews, and chair the session itself.



Each speaker invited to a Workshop and Special Session will be required to submit a paper, under the regular submission requirements, by the regular submission deadline. These papers will enter the same system as regular papers, and be subject to reviews. The Organizer will be asked to help with selection of reviewers and in consultation with the program committee will make accept/reject decisions. It is possible that some invited papers may be rejected. However, this is expected to be a rare case since the Organizer should recruit only the high-quality papers to the Workshop or Special Session.



The invited speakers as well as the Organizer will be required to register for the conference. Registration fees will not be waived and there will be no honorarium available through TSP.

Aim of the Conference ---------------------------- 

The automatic analysis of images and signals in medicine, biotechnology, System Biology, chemistry, biometry, drug discovery and information robots is a challenging and demanding field. Signal-producing procedures by microscopes, spectrometers and other sensors have found their way into wide fields of 

medicine, biotechnology, economy and environmental analysis. With this arises the problem of the automatic mass analysis of signal information. Signal-interpreting systems which generate automatically the desired target statements from the signals are therefore of compelling necessity. The continuation of mass analyses on the basis of the classical procedures leads to investments of proportions that are not feasible. New procedures and system architectures are therefore required. The scope of conference is to bring together researcher, praticioners and industry people who are dealing with mass analysis of images and signals to present and discuss recent research in these fields. 

 

The goals of this conference are to: - provide a forum for identifying important contributions and opportunities for research on mass data analysis on microscopic images, - promote the systematic study of how to apply automatic image analysis and interpretation procedures to that field - show case applications of mass data analysis in biology, medicine, and chemistry. 

 

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to): 

• Applications in Medicine, r/g/b Biotechnology, Food Industries and Dietetics, Biometry and Agriculture • Techniques and developments of signal and image producing procedures • Object matching and object tracking in microscopic and video microscopic images • 1D, 2D and 3D shape analysis and description • 1D, 2D and 3D feature extraction of texture, structure and location • Algorithms for 1D, 2D and 3D signal analysis and interpretation • Image segmentation algorithms • Parallelization of image analysis and interpretation algorithms 

• Semantic tagging of microscopic images • Applications in medicine, biotechnology, chemistry and others • Applications in crystallography • Applications in proteomics • Applications in 2D and 3D cell images analysis • Image Acquisition procedures for mass data analysis • Methods and solutions for biometrical systems (Face-, Iris and Fingerprint Recognition) • Recognition methods for moving objects (face, iris, body) • Methods for data encryption (e.g. crypotographic methods, watermarking)

--------------------------------------------------

Medical imaging is a technique to create visual representations of the inferior of the body, with the aim of making accurate decisions and appropriate treatments. Measurement and recording techniques are primarily designed to produce images, such as computer tomography (CT), ultrasound (US), positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/functional MRI (fMRI).



Nevertheless, human interpretation on medical images is tedious, and the slight lesions may be overlooked. This urges scholars to develop advanced signal processing methods for a wide of low-level and high-level applications. The low-level applications include image smoothing, image enhancement, image registration, image segmentation, image reconstruction, etc. The high-level applications can be used to determine the diameter, volume and vasculature of a tumor, to diagnose whether a subject is pathological and how severe it is. Those applications need more advanced techniques than ever, for example: computer vision, pattern recognition, soft computing, artificial intelligence, etc.



This special section aims to bring the latest results over advanced signal processing techniques in medical imaging. It can both help physicians and radiologists in the image interpretation, and help technicians to exchange the latest technical progresses.

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and signal processing are driving the growth of the artificial intelligence market as improved appropriate technologies is critical to offer enhanced drones, self-driving cars, robotics, etc. The two major factors enabling market growth are: emerging artificial intelligence technologies, and growth in intelligent signal processing. Today, more and more sensor manufacturers are using machine learning to sensors and signal data for analyses. It is becoming easier than ever: hardware is becoming smaller and sensors are getting cheaper, making Internet of things devices widely available for a variety of applications ranging from predictive maintenance to user behavior monitoring. However, the increased number of sensors in devices will inherently generate higher data throughput, which poses a serious challenge in managing and processing the tremendous amount of sensory information. Furthermore, traditional processing techniques in conventional sensing devices are no longer suitable for systematically labeling, processing, and analyzing the exuberant amount of information. The global artificial intelligence market size was valued at USD 62.4 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42.2% from 2020 to 2027 to rich 733.7 billion.



The global AI market growth is driven by increasing adoption of cloud-based applications and services growing big data increasing demand for intelligent virtual assistants advances in signal processing. The major restraint for such market is the limited number of AI technology experts. Today, there are approximately 300,000 AI researchers and practitioners worldwide, but the market demand is around millions of roles.



The series of ASPAI conferences have been launched to fill-in this gap and provide a forum for open discussion and development of emerging artificial intelligence and appropriate signal processing technologies focused on real-word implementations by offering Hardware, Software, Services, Technology (Machine Learning, Deep Learing Natural Language Processing, Context-Aware Computing, Computer Vision and Signal Processing). The goal of the conference is to provide an interactive environment for establishing collaboration, exchanging ideas, and facilitating discussion between researchers, manufacturers and users. The 1st ASPAI conference has taken place in Barcelona (Spain) in 2019, and the 2nd one - in Berlin (Germany) in 2020 (in online format).



The ASPAI' 2021 is organized by IFSA with the media partners IOS Press (journal Integrated Computer-Aided Engineering (ISSN: 1069-2509, e-ISSN: 1875-8835)) and World Scientific (International Journal of Neural Systems(ISSN: 0129-0657, e-ISSN: 1793-6462)).



The purpose of ASPAI' 2021 is bring together leading international researchers, developers and practitioners interested in artificial intelligence and appropriate signal processing technologies.

With increasing number of identity theft and miss-use incidents we do observe a significant fraud in e-commerce and thus growing interests on trustworthiness of person authentication. Nowa-days we find biometric applications in areas like border control, national ID cards, e-banking, e-commerce, e-health etc. Large-scale applications such as the European Union SmartBorder Concept, the Visa Information System (VIS) and Unique Identification (UID) in India require high accuracy and also reliability, interoperability, scalability and usability. Many of these are joint requirements also for forensic applications.

Multimodal biometrics combined with fusion techniques can improve recognition performance. Efficient searching or indexing methods can accelerate identification efficiency. Additionally, quality of captured biometric samples can strongly influence the performance. Moreover, mobile biometrics is an emerging area and biometrics based smartphones can support deployment and acceptance of biometric systems.

However, concerns about security and privacy cannot be neglected. The relevant techniques in the area of presentation attack detection (liveness detection) and template protection are about to supplement biometric systems, in order to improve fake resistance, prevent poten-tial attacks such as cross matching, identity theft etc. 

The BIOSIG 2018 conference addresses these issues and will present innovations and best practices that can be transferred into future applications. The conference is jointly organized by the Competence Center for Applied Security Technology (CAST), the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), the European Association for Biometrics (EAB), the Joint Research Centre of the European Com-mission (JRC), the TeleTrusT-Association, the Norwegian Biometrics Laboratory (NBL), the Center for Research in Security and Privacy (CRSIP), the Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research IGD, IET Biometrics Journal and the special interest group BIOSIG of the Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V. (GI). The conference will be technically co-sponsored by IEEE and papers will be added to IEEE Xplore (approval pending). 

We invite stakeholders and technical experts to submit original re-search papers. Industrial contributions presenting lessons learnt from practical usage, case study, recent results of prototypes, are also welcomed. 



Topics of the conference include but are not limited to: Biometric standards and interoperability, multimodal and multi-biometrics, security analysis of biometric components or systems, on-card com-parison, fake resistance, liveness detection, aging of reference data, template protection, de-identification, user interface design for biometric systems, biometric performance measurement, sample quality, best practices, usability, continuous authentication, forensics and other emerging applications, ethical, legal and socio-technological aspects, biometrics for public administrations.

We invite developers and users from the GNU Radio community to present your projects, presentations, papers, posters, and problems at GNU Radio Conference 2020.



GRCon20 will be held September 14-18, 2020 in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA.



You may make one or more submissions under the following categories for presentation at GRCon. In addition to submitting a presentation, you may submit a paper to the Technical Proceedings of GRCon20. You do not need to submit a paper to the Proceedings in order to present at GRCon.

Talks are 30 minutes long, including 5 minutes reserved for audience questions. Each presentation should be a slide-deck that can be shared publicly (PDF) after the conference. Real-world results using GNU Radio and hardware will be favored over simulation-only work.



Talks will be recorded and published on the GNU Radio YouTube channel after the conference.



Papers can be submitted with or without a talk. Authors are encouraged to attend the conference, but it is not a requirement for paper acceptance. Detailed real-world results using GNU Radio are encouraged.



Workshops are 1–4 hours long, and should have an educational or “How-To” approach, with a large hands on portion. If slides are used, they should be publicly shareable (PDF) after the conference.



Lightning Talks are very concise (4-5 minutes), talks on topics of high interest to GNU Radio users and developers, and provide a chance for new presenters to share their use cases, projects or demos.



Posters can display any type of material that you believe is interesting to the community, and while most posters are technical, they don’t have to be.



To submit your content for the conference, visit the submission page for more details and instructions: https://www.gnuradio.org/grcon/grcon20/submit/



Dates



Submission deadlines are split into two rounds:



First round closes 17 April 2020. Final round closes 1 September 2020.



All contributions submitted by 17 April 2020 will get a final decisions of acceptance by 29 June 2020. All contributions submitted between 17 April and 1 September will be accepted/rejected on a rolling basis. We do not guarantee a notification deadline for submissions after 17 April. Submissions for presentations may close sooner than 1 September if all available speaker slots are taken.



If you have questions or need assistance with the submission system, or have content that doesn't quite fit and you want to talk it over, please email us at grcon@gnuradio.org.



If your submission is accepted, you must register for the conference or your talk will be dropped from the schedule. Please use the speaker registration in this case in order to lock in the regular price.



Please note that submitting a paper to the Technical Proceedings is not required to submit a Talk, Tutorial, or Poster, but is strongly encouraged. You also do not need to attend the conference to publish in the Technical Proceedings.





We are looking forward to your submissions!

In conjunction with CVPR 2019



Website: http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/ntire19/

Contact: radu.timofte [at] vision.ee.ethz.ch



Scope



Image restoration and image enhancement are key computer vision tasks, aiming at the restoration of degraded image content, the filling in of missing information, or the needed transformation and/or manipulation to achieve a desired target (with respect to perceptual quality, contents, or performance of apps working on such images). Recent years have witnessed an increased interest from the vision and graphics communities in these fundamental topics of research. Not only has there been a constantly growing flow of related papers, but also substantial progress has been achieved.



Each step forward eases the use of images by people or computers for the fulfillment of further tasks, as image restoration or enhancement serves as an important frontend. Not surprisingly then, there is an ever growing range of applications in fields such as surveillance, the automotive industry, electronics, remote sensing, or medical image analysis etc. The emergence and ubiquitous use of mobile and wearable devices offer another fertile ground for additional applications and faster methods.



This workshop aims to provide an overview of the new trends and advances in those areas. Moreover, it will offer an opportunity for academic and industrial attendees to interact and explore collaborations.



This workshop builds upon the success of the previous NTIRE editions: at CVPR 2017 and 2018 and at ACCV 2016 . Moreover, it relies on all the people associated with the NTIRE past events such as organizers, PC members, distinguished speakers, authors of published paper, challenge participants and winning teams.





Topics



Papers addressing topics related to image/video restoration and enhancement are invited. The topics include, but are not limited to:



●    Image/video inpainting

●    Image/video deblurring

●    Image/video denoising

●    Image/video upsampling and super-resolution

●    Image/video filtering

●    Image/video dehazing

●    Demosaicing

●    Image/video compression

●    Artifact removal

●    Image/video enhancement: brightening, color adjustment, sharpening, etc.

●    Style transfer

●    Image/video generation and hallucination

●    Image/video quality assessment

●    Hyperspectral imaging

●    Underwater imaging

●    Aerial and satellite imaging

●    Methods robust to changing weather conditions / adverse outdoor conditions

●    Perceptual enhancement

●    Studies and applications of the above.





Submission



A paper submission has to be in English, in pdf format, and at most 8 pages (excluding references) in CVPR style. The paper format must follow the same guidelines as for all CVPR submissions.

http://cvpr2019.thecvf.com/submission/main_conference/author_guidelines

The review process is double blind. Authors do not know the names of the chair/reviewers of their papers. Reviewers do not know the names of the authors.

Dual submission is allowed with CVPR main conference only. If a paper is submitted also to CVPR and accepted, the paper cannot be published both at the CVPR and the workshop.



For the paper submissions, please go to the online submission site 

https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/NTIRE2019

BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING

Biomedical signal processing involves the analysis of these measurements to provide useful information upon which clinicians can make decisions. Engineers are discovering new ways to process these signals using a variety of mathematical formulae and algorithms. Working with traditional bio-measurement tools, the signals can be computed by software to provide physicians with real-time data and greater insights to aid in clinical assessments.



BIOMEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSING

Biomedical imaging concentrates on the capture of images for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Snapshots of in vivo physiology and physiological processes can be garnered through advanced sensors and computer technology. Biomedical image processing is similar in concept to biomedical signal processing in multiple dimensions. It includes the analysis, enhancement and display of images captured via x-ray, ultrasound, MRI, nuclear medicine and optical imaging technologies.



BIOINSTRUMENTATION AND SENSORS

A biosensor is any piece of hardware that interacts with a biological or physiological system to acquire a signal for either diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Data gathered using biosensors are then processed using biomedical signal processing techniques as a first step toward facilitating human or automated interpretation. The body sends out very weak electrical signals, which must somehow be captured and converted into useful information.



BIOINFORMATICS AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY

Both computational biology and bioinformatics draw upon many of the same disciplines to derive distinct, but related, information about biological processes. Understanding the functioning of living systems is the realm of the physiologist. Bioengineers working in computational biology might explore, for example, how blood flows through the body or how air flows through the lungs. This ""plumbing"""" can be mathematically modeled to help determine the health of an individual patient.



BIOMECHANICS AND BIOROBOTICS

The term ""biomechanics"" is used to describe the application of mechanics-the study of how motor systems create force and motion-to biological systems. Biomechanics often employs traditional engineering techniques. Biorobotic technologies are often utilized to provide assistance to accommodate a deficiency-either as fully-functioning robots or highly advanced prosthetics; the latter represents one area in which neural engineering and biorobotics intersect as both disciplines are required in order to first signal and then generate movement.



NEURAL AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING

Neural engineers are interested in understanding, interfacing with and manipulating the nervous system. Computational neuroscientists are creating computer models of neural systems down to the level of single neurons. Scientists are also exploring how neurons communicate with one another by taking recordings from actual neurons and having those recordings ""interact"" with recordings from other neurons. Using quantitative techniques, the nature of these communications are being measured and analyzed.



TISSUE ENGINEERING

Thousands of people die every year waiting for an organ transplant and far more are plagued by diseased organs. Those with spinal cord injuries suffer from many other health issues as a result of their inability to move and walk. And while we marvel at the prowess of surgeons able to transplant a face or hand, the results are far from perfect. Tissue engineering brings together several disciplines to create living tissue to replace or repair skin, a failing organ or a damaged or missing body part.



TELEMEDICINE

With critical care doctors in short supply and located in regional medical centers, ICUs became the first specialty to turn to the power of telemedicine. Telemedicine allows attending physicians in rural hospitals to consult with specialists at renowned institutions. This means that patient data must be transmitted and received both reliably and timely. Biomedical engineers are involved in the development of communication technologies and applications.



DIAGNOSTICS AND THERAPEUTIC SYSTEMS

The engineers who focus specifically on diagnostic and therapeutic systems address the practical aspects of research. Rather than exploring the features of cardiac arrhythmias, for example, they consider what, specifically, could be developed to detect such arrhythmias. They look at what is needed in medicine and then help to figure out how to apply the findings of researchers into a functional product."

You are cordially invited to contribute to the Artificial Intelligence and Signal Processing Conference (AISP2017) which is organized by Shiraz University and Computer Society of Iran to be held on October 25-27, 2017 in Shiraz (IRAN). The conference is a forum of excellence for the exploration of the frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Signal Processing.



The prestigious conference will be held in Shiraz, a city of magnificent diversity. The city of Persian poetry and civilization, and home to many touristic sites including the tomb of Hafez, a well-known Persian poet from the 14th century, and Saadi, another celebrated poet of the 13th century.  Persepolis (Takht-e-Jamshid), the capital of the Achaemenid Empire and one of the world’s most magnificent ancient sites, which was declared a world heritage site in 1979 by UNESCO, is only 60 km away. On the other hand, Shiraz University is among the top-ranked universities in Iran and its computer science department is the first computer science department established in Iran.

We invite scholars, professionals, researchers, and students to participate in AISP2017 by submitting their papers on topics related to Artificial Intelligence and Signal Processing. Prospective authors may refer to our website (www.shirazu.ac.ir/csi2017) or telegram channel (@CSI_2017) for detailed information and instructions on manuscript preparation and submission.

After the Conference, a selected number of best papers shall be expanded and revised for publishing in The Iranian Journal of Science & Technology (IJST) (ISSN: 1028-6284), which is indexed by ISI. 



Professional Track:



We also solicit experiment reports from the professional community. The wide gap between professional and scientific communities of Computer Engineering and the reasons theoretical principles are not applied in Iran are the main theme of the newly defined track. In this category, engineers and developers are encouraged to submit their success or failure experiences. These papers are solely reviewed based on the practical and applied knowledge they may provide for the professional community and how they may shorten the gap between the two communities of professionals and scientists."

Computational Audio Processing techniques have been largely addressed by scientists and technicians in many application areas, like entertainment, human-machine interfaces, security, forensics, and health. Depending on the problem under study, these techniques have been successfully applied to speech signal processing (speech/speaker recognition, speech enhancement, emotion and speaker state recognition, privacy-preserving speech processing), music information retrieval and automated music generation, and in generic sound processing for acoustic monitoring, acoustic scene understanding and sound separation, detection, and identification. In the case of animal vocalization analysis, some efforts have been recently spent in the automatic classification and recognition of animal species by means of their emitted sounds.



In the different fields, state of the art performance has recently been obtained by using data-driven learning systems, often represented by variants of deep neural network architectures. Several challenges remain open, due to the increasing complexity of the tasks, the presence of non-stationary operating conditions, the difference between laboratory and real acoustic scenarios, and the necessity to respect hard real-time constraints, also when the amount of data to process is big and battery-powered devices are involved. In some other application contexts, the challenge is facing a scarce amount of data to be used for training, and suitable architectures and algorithms need to be designed on purpose. Moreover, also the employment of cross-domain approaches to exploit the information contained in diverse kinds of environmental audio signals are often needed, as recently investigated by some pioneering works.



SCOPE AND TOPICS

The aim of this special session is to provide a forum for the presentation of the most recent advancements on Deep Neural Networks algorithms applied to Digital Audio problems, with particular attention to speech analysis and enhancement, music information retrieval and generation, as well as acoustic scenes and events detection and classification, exploring also new and emerging methods, such as end-to-end and one-shot/zero-shot learning.

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and signal processing are driving the growth of the artificial intelligence market as improved appropriate technologies is critical to offer enhanced drones, self-driving cars, robotics, etc. The two major factors enabling market growth are: emerging artificial intelligence technologies, and growth in intelligent signal processing. Today, more and more sensor manufacturers are using machine learning to sensors and signal data for analyses. It is becoming easier than ever: hardware is becoming smaller and sensors are getting cheaper, making Internet of things devices widely available for a variety of applications ranging from predictive maintenance to user behavior monitoring. However, the increased number of sensors in devices will inherently generate higher data throughput, which poses a serious challenge in managing and processing the tremendous amount of sensory information. Furthermore, traditional processing techniques in conventional sensing devices are no longer suitable for systematically labeling, processing, and analyzing the exuberant amount of information.The global artificial intelligence market size was valued at USD 62.4 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42.2% from 2020 to 2027 to rich 733.7 billion.



The global AI market growth is driven by increasing adoption of cloud-based applications and services growing big data increasing demand for intelligent virtual assistants advances in signal processing. The major restraint for such market is the limited number of AI technology experts. Today, there are approximately 300,000 AI researchers and practitioners worldwide, but the market demand is around millions of roles.

Biometrics provides efficient and reliable solutions to recognize individuals. With increasing number of identity theft and miss-use incidents we do observe a significant fraud in e-commerce and thus growing interests on trustworthiness of person authentication. Nowadays we find biometric applications in areas like border control, national ID cards, e-banking, e-commerce, e-health etc. Large-scale applications such as the European Union SmartBorder Concept, the Visa Information System (VIS) and Unique Identification (UID) in India require high accuracy and also reliability, interoperability, scalability and usability. Many of these are joint requirements also for forensic applications.



Multimodal biometrics combined with fusion techniques can improve recognition performance. Efficient searching or indexing methods can accelerate identification efficiency. Additionally, quality of captured biometric samples can strongly influence the performance. Moreover, mobile biometrics is an emerging area and biometrics based smartphones can support deployment and acceptance of biometric systems.

However, concerns about security and privacy cannot be neglected. The relevant techniques in the area of presentation attack detection (liveness detection) and template protection are about to supplement biometric systems, in order to improve fake resistance, prevent potential attacks such as cross matching, identity theft etc. 



The BIOSIG 2017 conference addresses these issues and will present innovations and best practices that can be transferred into future applications. The conference is jointly organized by the Competence Center for Applied Security Technology (CAST), the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), the European Association for Biometrics (EAB), the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC), the TeleTrusT-Association, the Norwegian Biometrics Laboratory (NBL), the Center for Research in Security and Privacy (CRSIP), the Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research IGD, IET Biometrics Journal and the special interest group BIOSIG of the Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V.

in conjunction with CVPR 2018



Website: http://www.compression.cc/





Motivation



The domain of image compression has traditionally used approaches discussed in forums such as ICASSP, ICIP and other very specialized venues like PCS, DCC, and ITU/MPEG expert groups. This workshop and challenge will be the first computer-vision event to explicitly focus on these fields. Many techniques discussed at computer-vision meetings have relevance for lossy compression. For example, super-resolution and artifact removal can be viewed as special cases of the lossy compression problem where the encoder is fixed and only the decoder is trained. But also inpainting, colorization, optical flow, generative adversarial networks and other probabilistic models have been used as part of lossy compression pipelines. Lossy compression is therefore a potential topic that can benefit a lot from a large portion of the CVPR community.



Recent advances in machine learning have led to an increased interest in applying neural networks to the problem of compression. At CVPR 2017, for example, one of the oral presentations was discussing compression using recurrent convolutional networks. In order to foster more growth in this area, this workshop will not only try to encourage more development but also establish baselines, educate, and propose a common benchmark and protocol for evaluation. This is crucial, because without a benchmark, a common way to compare methods, it will be very difficult to measure progress.



We propose hosting an image-compression challenge which specifically targets methods which have been traditionally overlooked, with a focus on neural networks (but also welcomes traditional approaches). Such methods typically consist of an encoder subsystem, taking images and producing representations which are more easily compressed than the pixel representation (e.g., it could be a stack of convolutions, producing an integer feature map), which is then followed by an arithmetic coder. The arithmetic coder uses a probabilistic model of integer codes in order to generate a compressed bit stream. The compressed bit stream makes up the file to be stored or transmitted. In order to decompress this bit stream, two additional steps are needed: first, an arithmetic decoder, which has a shared probability model with the encoder. This reconstructs (losslessly) the integers produced by the encoder. The last step consists of another decoder producing a reconstruction of the original image.



In the computer vision community many authors will be familiar with a multitude of configurations which can act as either the encoder and the decoder, but probably few are familiar with the implementation of an arithmetic coder/decoder. As part of our challenge, we therefore will release a reference arithmetic coder/decoder in order to allow the researchers to focus on the parts of the system for which they are experts.

While having a compression algorithm is an interesting feat by itself, it does not mean much unless the results it produces compare well against other similar algorithms and established baselines on realistic benchmarks. In order to ensure realism, we have collected a set of images which represent a much more realistic view of the types of images which are widely available (unlike the well established benchmarks which rely on the images from the Kodak PhotoCD, having a resolution of 768x512, or Tecnick, which has images of around 1.44 megapixels).  We will also provide the performance results from current state-of-the-art compression systems as baselines, like WebP and BPG.



Challenge Tasks



We provide two datasets: Dataset P (“professional”) and Dataset M (“mobile”).  The datasets are collected to be representative for images commonly used in the wild, containing thousands of images.



The challenge will allow participants to train neural networks or other methods on any amount of data (it should be possible to train on the data we provide, but we expect participants to have access to additional data, such as ImageNet). 

Participants will need to submit a decoder executable that can run in the provided docker environment and be capable of decompressing the submission files. We will impose reasonable limitations for compute and memory of the decoder executable.



We will rank participants (and baseline image compression methods – WebP, JPEG 2000, and BPG) based on multiple criteria: (a) decoding speed; (b) proxy perceptual metric (e.g., MS-SSIM Y); and (c) will utilize scores provided by human raters. The overall winner will be decided by a panel, whose goal is to determine the best compromise between runtime performance and bitrate savings.







Regular Paper Track



We will have a short (4 pages) regular paper track, which allows participants to share research ideas related to image compression. In addition to the paper, we will host a poster session during which authors will be able to discuss their work in more detail. 

We encourage exploratory research which shows promising results in:

●     Lossy image compression

●     Quantization (learning to quantize; dealing with quantization in optimization)

●     Entropy minimization

●     Image super-resolution for compression

●     Deblurring

●     Compression artifact removal

●     Inpainting (and compression by inpainting)

●     Generative adversarial networks

●     Perceptual metrics optimization and their applications to compression

And in particular, how these topics can improve image compression.





Challenge Paper Track



The challenge task participants are asked to submit materials detailing the algorithms which they submitted as part of the challenge. Furthermore, they are invited to submit a paper detailing their approach for the challenge.

You are cordially invited to contribute to the  Computer Society of Iran (CSI 2017)  which is organized by Shiraz University and Computer Society of Iran to be held on October 25-27, 2017 in Shiraz (IRAN). The conference is a forum of excellence for the exploration of the frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Signal Processing.

The prestigious conference will be held in Shiraz, a city of magnificent diversity. The city of Persian poetry and civilization, and home to many touristic sites including the tomb of Hafez, a well-known Persian poet from the 14th century, and Saadi, another celebrated poet of the 13th century. Persepolis (Takht-e-Jamshid), the capital of the Achaemenid Empire and one of the world’s most magnificent ancient sites, which was declared a world heritage site in 1979 by UNESCO, is only 60 km away. On the other hand, Shiraz University is among the top-ranked universities in Iran and its computer science department is the first computer science department established in Iran.

We invite scholars, professionals, researchers, and students to participate in CSSE 2017 by

submitting their papers on topics related to  Artificial Intelligence, Signal Processing and  Algorithms and emerging application. Prospective authors may refer to our website ( www.shirazu.ac.ir/csi2017 ) or telegram channel (@ CSI_2017 ) for detailed information and instructions on manuscript preparation and submission.

After the Conference, a selected number of best papers shall be expanded and revised for publishing in The Iranian Journal of Science & Technology (IJST) (ISSN: 1028-6284), which is indexed by ISI.

Professional Track:

We also solicit experiment reports from the professional community. The wide gap between professional and scientific communities of Computer Engineering and the reasons theoretical principles are not applied in Iran are the main theme of the newly defined track. In this category, engineers and developers are encouraged to submit their success or failure experiences. These papers are solely reviewed based on the practical and applied knowledge they may provide for the professional community and how they may shorten the gap between the two communities of professionals and scientists."

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) approaches, well known from Computer Science disciplines, are beginning to emerge in the RF Signal Processing, Communications and Networking domains. However, there are various challenges arising in the application of Machine Learning to RF signals, such as inherently high data rates, sensitivity to environmental effects (noise, multi-path, interference etc), presence of multi-scale features in both frequency and time domains, to name a few. Also, in contrast to the image and text processing domains, the scarcity of large public repositories of standardized RF signal data makes it harder for academic and industry researchers to test and validate their algorithms in a robust, reproducible, and scalable fashion. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from the RF Signal Processing and Machine Learning communities, showcase state-of-the-art Machine Learning approaches applicable in the RF domain, and provide a forum for discussing cross-disciplinary ideas to address present and future challenges. 



Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Machine Learning for blind channel and signal characterization

* Machine Learning for source separation

* Machine Learning for RF signal classification

* Machine Learning for cognitive radio communications, for instance spectrum awareness, or optimization of spectrum usage dynamics and spectrum access control

* Quality of unsupervised learning with corrupted, censored and missing spectrum sensing samples

* Privacy-preserving Machine Learning for cognitive radio communications, for instance in 5G cellular networks

* Machine Learning for RF-based geo-location

* Distributed learning in collaborative autonomous networked multi-agent systems

* Adversarial Machine Learning techniques applied to RF systems

* Machine Learning techniques for RF systems security

* Reinforcement learning in wireless communication and sensor networks

* Transfer Learning for wireless communication and sensor networks

* Visual analysis of learned features in Deep Learning for RF signal processing

* Machine Learning techniques for communications and sensing convergence

The last decade has seen a paradigm shift from expert-designed algorithms to data-driven approaches. Machine learning approaches, and Deep Neural Networks specifically, have been shown to outperform traditional approaches on a large variety of tasks including audio classification, source separation, enhancement, and content analysis. With data-driven approaches, however, came a set of new challenges. Two of these challenges are training data and interpretability. As supervised machine learning approaches increase in complexity, the increasing need for more annotated training data can often not be matched with available data. The lack of understanding of how data are modeled by neural networks can lead to unexpected results and open vulnerabilities for adversarial attacks.



The main aim of this Special Issue is to seek high-quality submissions that present novel data-driven methods for audio/music signal processing and analysis and address main challenges of applying machine learning to audio signals. Within the general area of audio and music information retrieval as well as audio and music processing, the topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:



    - unsupervised and semi-supervised systems for audio/music processing and analysis

    - machine learning methods for raw audio signal analysis and transformation

    - approaches to understanding and controlling the behavior of audio processing systems such as visualization, auralization, or regularization methods

    - generative systems for sound synthesis and transformation

    - adversarial attacks and the identification of 'deepfakes' in audio and music

    - audio and music style transfer methods

    - audio recording and music production parameter estimation

    - data collection methods, active learning, and interactive machine learning for data-driven approaches

However, modern technologies have fueled an ever-increasing number of emerging applications in which signals relies on unconventional algebraic structures (e.g., non-commutative). In this context, advanced complex- and hypercomplex-valued signal processing encompasses many of these challenging areas. In the complex domain, the augmented statistics have been found to be very effective in different methods of machine learning and nonlinear signal processing. However, processing signals in hypercomplex domains enables us to exploit some different properties, albeit raising challenges in designing and implementing new and more effective learning algorithms. More generally, learning in the hypercomplex domain allows us to process multidimensional data as a single entity rather than modelling as a multichannel entity, hence preserving the integrity of the data. In that direction, quaternions have attracted attention in the signal processing and machine learning communities for their capability of dealing with 3D and 4D models.



The aim of this special session is to bring together leading researchers in the fields of signal processing and machine learning and provide advances on learning methods in complex and hypercomplex domains that can empower science and technology for humankind. 







List of Topics:

- Advanced Complex-Valued Learning Methods

- Complex-Valued Nonlinear Adaptive Filters

- Clifford and Geometric Algebras for Adaptive Filtering and Signal Processing

- Hypercomplex Machine Learning

- Complex- and Quaternion-Valued Neural Networks

- Complex- and Hypercomplex-Valued Activation Functions

- Sparse Representations in the Hypercomplex Domain

- Complex and Hypercomplex Learning over Graphs and Networks

- Algorithms for Hypercomplex Optimization

- Advances in Image Processing using Quaternions

- Audio Processing in the Hypercomplex Domain

- Emerging Fields of Applications in the Hypercomplex Domain"

in conjunction with CVPR 2019



Website: http://www.compression.cc/





Motivation



The domain of image compression has traditionally used approaches discussed in forums such as ICASSP, ICIP and other very specialized venues like PCS, DCC, and ITU/MPEG expert groups. This workshop and challenge will be the first computer-vision event to explicitly focus on these fields. Many techniques discussed at computer-vision meetings have relevance for lossy compression. For example, super-resolution and artifact removal can be viewed as special cases of the lossy compression problem where the encoder is fixed and only the decoder is trained. But also inpainting, colorization, optical flow, generative adversarial networks and other probabilistic models have been used as part of lossy compression pipelines. Lossy compression is therefore a potential topic that can benefit a lot from a large portion of the CVPR community.



Recent advances in machine learning have led to an increased interest in applying neural networks to the problem of compression. At CVPR 2017, for example, one of the oral presentations was discussing compression using recurrent convolutional networks. In order to foster more growth in this area, this workshop will not only try to encourage more development but also establish baselines, educate, and propose a common benchmark and protocol for evaluation. This is crucial, because without a benchmark, a common way to compare methods, it will be very difficult to measure progress.



We propose hosting an image-compression challenge which specifically targets methods which have been traditionally overlooked, with a focus on neural networks (but also welcomes traditional approaches). Such methods typically consist of an encoder subsystem, taking images and producing representations which are more easily compressed than the pixel representation (e.g., it could be a stack of convolutions, producing an integer feature map), which is then followed by an arithmetic coder. The arithmetic coder uses a probabilistic model of integer codes in order to generate a compressed bit stream. The compressed bit stream makes up the file to be stored or transmitted. In order to decompress this bit stream, two additional steps are needed: first, an arithmetic decoder, which has a shared probability model with the encoder. This reconstructs (losslessly) the integers produced by the encoder. The last step consists of another decoder producing a reconstruction of the original image.



In the computer vision community many authors will be familiar with a multitude of configurations which can act as either the encoder and the decoder, but probably few are familiar with the implementation of an arithmetic coder/decoder. As part of our challenge, we therefore will release a reference arithmetic coder/decoder in order to allow the researchers to focus on the parts of the system for which they are experts.



While having a compression algorithm is an interesting feat by itself, it does not mean much unless the results it produces compare well against other similar algorithms and established baselines on realistic benchmarks. In order to ensure realism, we have collected a set of images which represent a much more realistic view of the types of images which are widely available (unlike the well established benchmarks which rely on the images from the Kodak PhotoCD, having a resolution of 768x512, or Tecnick, which has images of around 1.44 megapixels). We will also provide the performance results from current state-of-the-art compression systems as baselines, like WebP and BPG.



Challenge Tasks



We will be running two tracks on the the challenge: low-rate compression, to judged on the quality, and “transparent” compression, to be judged by the bit rate. For the low-rate compression track, there will be a bitrate threshold that must be met. For the transparent track, there will be several quality thresholds that must be met. In all cases, the submissions will be judged based on the aggregate results across the test set: the test set will be treated as if it were a single ‘target’, instead of (for example) evaluating bpp or PSNR on each image separately.



For the low-rate compression track, the requirement will be that the compression is to less than 0.15 bpp across the full test set. The maximum size of the sum of all files will be released with the test set. In addition, a decoder executable has to be submitted that can run in the provided Docker environment and is capable of decompressing the submitted files. We will impose reasonable limitations for compute and memory of the decoder executable. The submissions in this track that are at or below that bitrate threshold will then be evaluated for best PSNR, best MS-SSIM, and best MOS from human raters.



For the transparent compression track, the requirement will be that the compression quality is at least 40 dB (aggregated) PSNR; at least 0.993 (aggregated) MS-SSIM; and a reasonable quality level using the Butteraugli measure (final values will be announced later). The submissions in this track that are at or better than these quality thresholds will then be evaluated for lowest total bitrate.



We provide the same two training datasets as we did last year: Dataset P (“professional”) and Dataset M (“mobile”). The datasets are collected to be representative for images commonly used in the wild, containing around two thousand images. The challenge will allow participants to train neural networks or other methods on any amount of data (it should be possible to train on the data we provide, but we expect participants to have access to additional data, such as ImageNet).



Participants will need to submit a file for each test image.



Prizes will given to the winners of the challenges. This is possible thanks to the sponsors.



To ensure that the decoder is not optimized for the test set, we will require the teams to use one of the decoders submitted in the validation phase of the challenge.







Regular Paper Track



We will have a short (4 pages) regular paper track, which allows participants to share research ideas related to image compression. In addition to the paper, we will host a poster session during which authors will be able to discuss their work in more detail. 

We encourage exploratory research which shows promising results in:

●     Lossy image compression

●     Quantization (learning to quantize; dealing with quantization in optimization)

●     Entropy minimization

●     Image super-resolution for compression

●     Deblurring

●     Compression artifact removal

●     Inpainting (and compression by inpainting)

●     Generative adversarial networks

●     Perceptual metrics optimization and their applications to compression

And in particular, how these topics can improve image compression.





Challenge Paper Track



The challenge task participants are asked to submit a short paper (up to 4 pages) detailing the algorithms which they submitted as part of the challenge.

Aim of the Conference ---------------------------- 

The automatic analysis of images and signals in medicine, biotechnology, System Biology, chemistry, biometry, drug discovery and information robots is a challenging and demanding field. Signal-producing procedures by microscopes, spectrometers and other sensors have found their way into wide fields of 

medicine, biotechnology, economy and environmental analysis. With this arises the problem of the automatic mass analysis of signal information. Signal-interpreting systems which generate automatically the desired target statements from the signals are therefore of compelling necessity. The continuation of mass analyses on the basis of the classical procedures leads to investments of proportions that are not feasible. New procedures and system architectures are therefore required. The scope of conference is to bring together researcher, praticioners and industry people who are dealing with mass analysis of images and signals to present and discuss recent research in these fields. 

 

The goals of this conference are to: - provide a forum for identifying important contributions and opportunities for research on mass data analysis on microscopic images, - promote the systematic study of how to apply automatic image analysis and interpretation procedures to that field - show case applications of mass data analysis in biology, medicine, and chemistry. 

 

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to): 

• Applications in Medicine, r/g/b Biotechnology, Food Industries and Dietetics, Biometry and Agriculture • Techniques and developments of signal and image producing procedures • Object matching and object tracking in microscopic and video microscopic images • 1D, 2D and 3D shape analysis and description • 1D, 2D and 3D feature extraction of texture, structure and location • Algorithms for 1D, 2D and 3D signal analysis and interpretation • Image segmentation algorithms • Parallelization of image analysis and interpretation algorithms 

• Semantic tagging of microscopic images • Applications in medicine, biotechnology, chemistry and others • Applications in crystallography • Applications in proteomics • Applications in 2D and 3D cell images analysis • Image Acquisition procedures for mass data analysis • Methods and solutions for biometrical systems (Face-, Iris and Fingerprint Recognition) • Recognition methods for moving objects (face, iris, body) • Methods for data encryption (e.g. crypotographic methods, watermarking)

Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are nowadays daily employed by more than 3 billion people, with an expected further worldwide penetration up to 5 billion users by 2025. Among the reasons for such astonishing growth, from the early years of mobile communications to the present day, there is the fact that modern mobile devices offer the possibility to perform many tasks and access several services, such as taking pictures or perform on-line payments, with an extreme ease of use. As a matter of fact, the share of internet users making mobile online payments is above 30% in most regions of the world.



As the next step in terms of technological revolution, wearable devices such as smart glasses, chestbands, and wristbands, are also rapidly becoming widespread. Thanks to their ability in capturing physiological signals like those related to the heart rate, a vast number of applications is being developed for wearable platforms, ranging from activity tracker and healthcare to social sharing in the context of the Internet of Things.



It has yet to be observed that most of the services which can be performed through mobile and wearable devices are typically accessed and used by providing sensitive and valuable data, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and so forth. Furthermore, the information commonly captured by the sensors with which these devices are equipped, and stored within them, is highly personal, with consequent possible security and privacy issues in case unauthorized subjects try to access such content.



It is therefore of paramount importance to design effective and secure mechanisms to access these devices. In this regard, resorting to biometric recognition systems seems a natural choice. Mobile and wearable devices are in fact commonly equipped with several sensors which could be exploited to acquire discriminative traits, thus allowing to recognize the authorized users.



Furthermore, the possibility of performing biometric recognition within mobile and wearable devices may come in handy to use them as authenticating tokens, providing the means to perform decentralized access control, thus exploiting mobile and wearable technology as authenticating means by combining their capabilities with biometric solutions. Such approach would for instance allow to design reliable systems performing continuous recognition, monitoring the identity of a subject during a period of indefinite temporal extension, hence providing robustness against session hi-jacking, in which an intruder may seize control of an ongoing session after a successful login of a legitimate user.



It is yet worth remarking that the systems to be implemented for such devices should be designed while taking into account the specific peculiarities of the considered scenarios. For instance, with respect to solutions dedicated to desktop systems, where physical characteristics are commonly preferred, approaches based on either behavioural or cognitive traits might be more appropriate when dealing with mobile and wearable devices. The computational complexity of the required processing may also represent a concern for systems with limited resources available.



The present special issue therefore seeks for recent and innovative developments in pattern recognition fields with applications to the design of biometric recognition systems for mobile and wearable devices. Topics of interest include, for example, the analysis and processing of the discriminative information (biosignals, images) which can be captured through mobile and wearable devices, the design of hardware architectures or software packages which could be effectively implemented in such environments, the proposal of machine learning approaches requiring limited computational resources, among others.



The topics of the Special Issue include, but are not limited to:



    Mobile biometrics in the wild;

    Continuous biometric recognition using wearable devices;

    Sensors for wearable technology (smartwatches, smart eyewear, smart t-shirt, etc.);

    Physical and behavioral in the mobile environment;

    Cognitive biometrics for wearable devices;

    Age and aging effects in mobile biometrics;

    Machine learning with limited computational resources;

    Biometric template protection: challenges and solutions in the mobile environment;

In this continuous effort Smart Water Networks (SWN) have an inherited dependence on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), since the latter provides the technological suite to deliver reliable, scalable, and secure architectures in highly-adapting environments. Nevertheless, numerous technical and research challenges must be jointly addressed. Front-end raw sensing should be elevated to collaborative edge-processing, which is capable of adapting to the spatial and temporal dynamics of underground and underwater environments. Distributed intelligence and control should be combined with scalable computing architectures to efficiently address the necessity of timely failure detection and isolation. Novel paradigms on security and safety against contamination should be embedded to the network backbone of SWN architecture. High-level data analytics are required to empower end-users, and allow highly-interactive, real-time water resources management. All in all, the existing plethora of highly customized ICT-based water management solutions should be replaced by a science of systems integration, in order to enable the standardized interaction of communication, processing, and control CPS modules that are tailored to the needs of water applications.



The objective of CySWater2017 is to bring together researchers and engineers from the fields of Communications/Networking, Learning/Processing, and Control and practitioners from the Water Industry to both share their experiences, as well as formulate novel CPS paradigms for fulfilling the vision of SWN. Emphasis will be given to theoretical modelling; modern exemplars that respond to different aspects of the water life-cycle; current trends on standardization and CPS integration for water resources optimization.





Topics of interest include but are not limited to:



    Data Acquisition, Processing & Learning:



    - Infrastructure & smart sensor devices for SWN



    - Signal sampling, classification & anomaly detection for SWN



    - Decentralized multi-sensor fusion, learning & data analytics.



    CPS-Architectures for smart water networks:



    - Underground & underwater CPS



    - Networked Control Systems architecture, incl. cloud & distributed computing aspects



    - CPS and security for SWN.



    Analysis, Performance, & Applications:



    - Testbeds, field studies, & performance analysis



    - Novel CPS paradigms for modern water management (e.g., treatment/recycle/reuse, wasterwater management).



    Emerging topics:



    - Smart water standardization policies



    - User-empowerment in water systems



    - Privacy and water data ownership



    - Water-food-energy nexus



    - CPS design for extreme water events."

Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, IF=1.215 (Clarivate Analytics Web of Science)



Scope



Biometrics is aimed at recognizing individuals based on physical, physiological, or behavioural characteristics of a human body such as fingerprint, gait, voice, iris, and gaze. Currently, the state-of-the art methods for biometric authentication are being incorporated in various access control and personal identity management applications. While the hand-based biometrics (including fingerprint) have been the most often used technology so far, there is growing evidence that electroencephalogram (EEG) signals collected during a perception or mental task can be used for reliable person recognition. However, the domain of EEG-based biometry still faces the problems of improving the accuracy, robustness, security, privacy, and ergonomics of EEG-based biometric systems and substantial efforts are needed towards developing efficient sets of stimuli (visual or auditory) that can be used of person identification in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems and applications.



There are still many challenging problems involved in improving the accuracy, efficiency, and usability of EEG-based biometric systems and problems related to designing, developing, and deploying new security-related BCI applications, for example, for personal authentication on mobile devices, VR (Virtual Reality) headsets, and Internet.



This special issue aims to introduce the recent progress of EEG-based biometrics and addresses the challenges in developing EEG-based biometry systems for various practical applications, while proposing new ideas and directions for future development.



Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:



EEG biometry

Data preprocessing, feature extraction, recognition, and matching for EEG-based biometric systems

Signal processing and machine learning techniques for EEG-based biometrics

EEG biometric based passwords and encryption

Cancellable EEG biometrics

Multimodal (EEG, EMG, ECG, and other biosignals) biometrics

individuals. With increasing number of identity theft and miss-use

incidents we do observe a significant fraud in e-commerce and thus

growing interests on trustworthiness of person authentication. 

Nowadays we find biometric applications in areas like border control,

national ID cards, e-banking, e-commerce, e-health etc. Large-scale

applications such as the upcoming European Union Entry Exit System (EES), 

the Visa Information System (VIS) and Unique Identification (UID) in India 

require high accuracy and also reliability, interoperability, scalability 

and usability. Many of these are joint requirements also for forensic applications.



Multimodal biometrics combined with fusion techniques can improve

recognition performance. Efficient searching or indexing methods can

accelerate identification efficiency. Additionally, quality of captured

biometric samples can strongly influence the performance. Moreover,

mobile biometrics is an emerging area and biometrics-based

smartphones can support deployment and acceptance of biometric

systems.



However, concerns about security and privacy cannot be neglected.

The relevant techniques in the area of presentation attack detection

(liveness detection) and template protection are about to supplement

biometric systems, in order to improve fake resistance, prevent potential 

attacks such as cross matching, identity theft etc.



The BIOSIG 2021 conference addresses these issues and will present

innovations and best practices that can be transferred into future

applications. The conference is jointly organized by the Competence

Center for Applied Security Technology (CAST), the German Federal

Office for Information Security (BSI), the European Association for

Biometrics (EAB), the TeleTrusT-Association, the Norwegian Biometrics 

Laboratory (NBL), National Research Center for Applied

Cybersecurity (ATHENE), the Fraunhofer Institute for Computer

Graphics Research IGD, IET Biometrics Journal and the special

interest group BIOSIG of the Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V. (GI). The

conference proceedings will be submitted to the IEEE Xplore Digital

Library®.



We invite stakeholders and technical experts to submit original research

papers. Industrial contributions presenting lessons learnt from practical

usage, case study, recent results of prototypes, are also welcomed.

We plan to organise the conference as hybrid event with on-site activities and

options for remote participation.

Aim of the Conference ---------------------------- 

The automatic analysis of images and signals in medicine, biotechnology, System Biology, chemistry, biometry, drug discovery and information robots is a challenging and demanding field. Signal-producing procedures by microscopes, spectrometers and other sensors have found their way into wide fields of 

medicine, biotechnology, economy and environmental analysis. With this arises the problem of the automatic mass analysis of signal information. Signal-interpreting systems which generate automatically the desired target statements from the signals are therefore of compelling necessity. The continuation of mass analyses on the basis of the classical procedures leads to investments of proportions that are not feasible. New procedures and system architectures are therefore required. The scope of conference is to bring together researcher, praticioners and industry people who are dealing with mass analysis of images and signals to present and discuss recent research in these fields. 

 

The goals of this conference are to: - provide a forum for identifying important contributions and opportunities for research on mass data analysis on microscopic images, - promote the systematic study of how to apply automatic image analysis and interpretation procedures to that field - show case applications of mass data analysis in biology, medicine, and chemistry. 

 

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to): 

• Applications in Medicine, r/g/b Biotechnology, Food Industries and Dietetics, Biometry and Agriculture • Techniques and developments of signal and image producing procedures • Object matching and object tracking in microscopic and video microscopic images • 1D, 2D and 3D shape analysis and description • 1D, 2D and 3D feature extraction of texture, structure and location • Algorithms for 1D, 2D and 3D signal analysis and interpretation • Image segmentation algorithms • Parallelization of image analysis and interpretation algorithms 

• Semantic tagging of microscopic images • Applications in medicine, biotechnology, chemistry and others • Applications in crystallography • Applications in proteomics • Applications in 2D and 3D cell images analysis • Image Acquisition procedures for mass data analysis • Methods and solutions for biometrical systems (Face-, Iris and Fingerprint Recognition) • Recognition methods for moving objects (face, iris, body) • Methods for data encryption (e.g. crypotographic methods, watermarking)

Such paradigm change involved also the audio processing field, where Deep Neural methods had a major impact in several research areas. In speech recognition, the advent of Deep Neural Networks provided significant reduction of word error rates in many popular tasks. Similar benefits have been registered in the speaker recognition and computational para-linguistics (e.g., emotion and speaker state recognition) research fields. Deep Neural methods found application also in fields where data-driven methods were scarcely employed, such as single and multi-channel speech enhancement and dereverberation. Such technologies have not remained confined to academic research, but they also found application in popular commercial products, such as Amazon Echo, Google Home, and Apple HomePod. Audio processing with Deep Neural methods has found application also in the music research field, such as in music information retrieval, automated music generation, and style transfer. Processing of environmental sounds has gained particular attention in the last years, and Deep Neural methods gained state of the art performance in tasks such as acoustic monitoring, audio tagging, acoustic scene understanding and sound separation, detection, and identification.

Neural methods achieved state of the art performance in the aforementioned research fields, but several challenges still remain open: robustness of recognition systems to environmental noise has a long history, and despite the recent advancements it still remains a topic worth of investigation. Adversarial attacks have proven successful to fool state of the art recognition models, thus posing important security issues. Usually, Deep Neural methods need large amounts of data in order to reach state of the art performance. In some application scenarios, however, the amount of data at disposal for training is scarce and techniques such as few-shot learning and transfer learning must be adopted. In other application contexts, the computational and memory resources of the executing device are limited, and neural models cannot be employed without modification. Model compression and knowledge distillation techniques have been gaining significant attention in the last years, since they allow to lower the computational and memory burden with little or no performance deterioration.

In the light of this analysis, it is indeed of great interest for the scientific community to understand how and to what extent novel Deep Neural Networks-based techniques can be efficiently employed in Digital Audio. The aim of the session is thus to focus on the most recent advancements in this field and on their applicability to Digital Audio problems. Driven by the constantly increasing success encountered at IJCNN2014 in Beijing (China), IJCNN2015 in Killarney (Ireland), IJCNN2016 in Vancouver (Canada), IJCNN2017 in Anchorage (Alaska, USA), and IJCNN2018 in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) the proposers of this session are motivated to revive and exceed the experience and to build, in the long-term, a solid reference within the Computational Intelligence community for the Digital Audio field.



Topics include, but are not limited to:

•  Computational audio analysis

•  Deep learning algorithms in digital audio

•  Knowledge distillation in digital audio applications

•  Transfer learning, few-shot learning in audio applications

•  Music information retrieval

•  Music content analysis

•  Speech and speaker analysis and classification

•  Neural methods for music/speech generation and voice conversion

•  Generative Adversarial Networks for Audio Analysis and Synthesis

•  Privacy preserving computational speech processing

•  Audio source separation using deep models

•  Sound event detection

•  Acoustic novelty detection

•  Acoustic scene analysis

•  End-to-end learning for digital audio applications

•  Single and multi-channel audio enhancement with neural networks

•  Robust audio processing towards adversarial attacks

•  Unsupervised methods for audio analysis

•  Attention-based Topologies

•  Explainability in Deep Learning for Audio Processing



Manuscripts intended for the special session should be submitted via the paper submission website of IJCNN 2019 as regular submissions. All papers submitted to special sessions will be subject to the same peer-review review procedure as the regular papers. Accepted papers will be part of the regular conference proceedings.

With increasing number of identity theft and miss-use incidents we do observe a significant fraud in e-commerce and thus growing interests on trustworthiness of person authentication. Nowa-days we find biometric applications in areas like border control, national ID cards, e-banking, e-commerce, e-health etc. Large-scale applications such as the European Union SmartBorder Concept, the Visa Information System (VIS) and Unique Identification (UID) in India require high accuracy and also reliability, interoperability, scalability and usability. Many of these are joint requirements also for forensic applications.

Multimodal biometrics combined with fusion techniques can improve recognition performance. Efficient searching or indexing methods can accelerate identification efficiency. Additionally, quality of captured biometric samples can strongly influence the performance. Moreover, mobile biometrics is an emerging area and biometrics based smartphones can support deployment and acceptance of biometric systems.

However, concerns about security and privacy cannot be neglected. The relevant techniques in the area of presentation attack detection (liveness detection) and template protection are about to supplement biometric systems, in order to improve fake resistance, prevent poten-tial attacks such as cross matching, identity theft etc.

The BIOSIG 2018 conference addresses these issues and will present innovations and best practices that can be transferred into future applications. The conference is jointly organized by the Competence Center for Applied Security Technology (CAST), the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), the European Association for Biometrics (EAB), the Joint Research Centre of the European Com-mission (JRC), the TeleTrusT-Association, the Norwegian Biometrics Laboratory (NBL), the Center for Research in Security and Privacy (CRSIP), the Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research IGD, IET Biometrics Journal and the special interest group BIOSIG of the Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V. (GI). The conference will be technically co-sponsored by IEEE and papers will be added to IEEE Xplore (approval pending).

We invite stakeholders and technical experts to submit original re-search papers. Industrial contributions presenting lessons learnt from practical usage, case study, recent results of prototypes, are also welcomed.



Topics of the conference include but are not limited to: Biometric standards and interoperability, multimodal and multi-biometrics, security analysis of biometric components or systems, on-card com-parison, fake resistance, liveness detection, aging of reference data, template protection, de-identification, user interface design for biometric systems, biometric performance measurement, sample quality, best practices, usability, continuous authentication, forensics and other emerging applications, ethical, legal and socio-technological aspects, biometrics for public administrations.

The 15th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems, ICSPCS 2021, follows the very successful ICSPCS’2019 and ICSPCS’2020. A major objective of the Conference will be to pursue the progression from communication and information theory through to the implementation, evaluation and performance improvement of practical communication systems using signal processing technology including AI. The Conference is also planned to be a forum for presenting research into topics ranging from those of the physical layer to the application layer. All aspects of the protocols and processes required for the future communication systems to operate better and the applications to utilize the full potential offered by the current and the emerging networking infrastructure are also encompassed. Papers dealing with signal processing for 5G and beyond and for minimizing energy use (Green Communications) are very welcome, too. Similarly, the conference welcomes papers considering protocols for the Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Grid.

In addition, we expect that, as during the previous events, there will be several papers dealing with image, video and audio processing for multimedia, medical and forensic applications, with the security of networks and information transmitted and stored, as well as other unconventional applications of signal processing and/or telecommunications modeling techniques.

Each of the submitted papers will receive 3 independent reviews and it is expected that the acceptance rate will be around 30 to 40% and not exceed 50%. 

As in the previous years, the conference is technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Communications Society. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the conference proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore as well as other Abstracting and Indexing (A&I) databases.

The Scope of the Conference

The automatic analysis of images and signals in medicine, biotechnology, System Biology, chemistry, biometry, drug discovery and information robots is a challenging and demanding field. Signal-producing procedures by microscopes, spectrometers and other sensors have found their way into wide fields of medicine, biotechnology, economy and environmental analysis. With this arises the problem of the automatic mass analysis of signal information. Signal-interpreting systems which generate automatically the desired target statements from the signals are therefore of compelling necessity. The continuation of mass analyses on the basis of the classical procedures leads to investments of proportions that are not feasible. New procedures and system architectures are therefore required. The scope of conference is to bring together researcher, praticioners and industry people who are dealing with mass analysis of images and signals to present and discuss recent research in these fields.

Scope





Image manipulation is a key computer vision tasks, aiming at the restoration of degraded image content, the filling in of missing information, or the needed transformation and/or manipulation to achieve a desired target (with respect to perceptual quality, contents, or performance of apps working on such images). Recent years have witnessed an increased interest from the vision and graphics communities in these fundamental topics of research. Not only has there been a constantly growing flow of related papers, but also substantial progress has been achieved.



Each step forward eases the use of images by people or computers for the fulfillment of further tasks, as image manipulation serves as an important frontend. Not surprisingly then, there is an ever growing range of applications in fields such as surveillance, the automotive industry, electronics, remote sensing, or medical image analysis etc. The emergence and ubiquitous use of mobile and wearable devices offer another fertile ground for additional applications and faster methods.



This workshop aims to provide an overview of the new trends and advances in those areas. Moreover, it will offer an opportunity for academic and industrial attendees to interact and explore collaborations.



This workshop builds upon the success of the Advances in Image Manipulation (AIM) workshop at ICCV 2020, the Perceptual Image Restoration and Manipulation (PIRM) workshop at ECCV 2018, the workshop and Challenge on Learned Image Compression (CLIC) editions at CVPR 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the New Trends in Image Restoration and Enhancement (NTIRE) editions: at CVPR 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and at ACCV 2016.
