Digital libraries that store scientific publications are becoming 

increasingly central to the research process. They are not only used 

for traditional tasks, such as finding and storing research outputs, 

but also as a source for discovering new research trends or evaluating 

research excellence. With the current growth of scientific publications 

deposited in digital libraries, it is no longer sufficient to provide 

only access to content. To aid research it is especially important 

to improve the process of how research is being done. 



The recent development in natural language processing, information 

retrieval and the semantic web make it possible to transform the way 

we work with scientific publications. However, in order to be able 

to improve these technologies and carry out experiments, researchers 

need to be able to easily access and use large databases of scientific 

publications.



This workshop aims to bring together people from different backgrounds who: 



(a) are interested in analysing and mining databases of scientific 

publications,



(b) develop systems that enable such analysis and mining of scientific 

databases or 



(c) who develop novel technologies that improve the way research is being done.



2. TOPICS



The topics of the workshop will be organised around the following themes:



1) The whole ecosystem of infrastructures including repositories, aggregators, 

text-and data-mining facilities, impact monitoring tools, datasets, services 

and APIs that enable analysis of large volumes of scientific publications. 



2) Semantic enrichment of scientific publications by means of text-mining, 

crowdsourcing or other methods.



3) Analysis of large databases of scientific publications to identify 

research trends, high impact, cross-fertilisation between disciplines, 

research excellence etc. 



Topics of interest relevant to theme 1 include, but are not limited to:



- Infrastructures including repositories, aggregators, 

text-and data-mining facilities, impact monitoring tools, datasets, 

services and APIs for accessing scientific publications and/or 

research data. The existence of datasets, services, systems and 

APIs (in particular those that are open) providing access to large 

volumes of scientific publications and research data, is an essential 

prerequisite for being able to research and develop new technologies 

that can transform the way people do research.



Topics of interest relevant to theme 2 include, but are not limited to:



- Novel information extraction and text-mining approaches to semantic 

enrichment of publications.

- Automatic categorization and clustering of scientific publications.

- New methods and models for connecting and interlinking scientific

publications.

- Models for semantically representing and annotating publications.

- Semantically enriching/annotating publications by crowdsourcing. 



Topics of interest relevant to theme 3 include, but are not limited to:



- New methods, models and innovative approaches for measuring impact

of publications.

- New methods for measuring performance of researchers.

- Evaluating impact of research groups.

- Methods for identifying research trends and cross-fertilization 

between research disciplines.

- Application and case studies of mining from scientific databases 

and publications.

- Improving the infrastructure of repositories to support 

the development and integration of new impact and performance metrics.



3. SPECIAL OPEN PUBLICATIONS DATASET TRACK



This year we would like to invite the workshop participants to make use of 

the CORE publications dataset containing large volume of research publications 

from a wide variety of research areas. The dataset contains not only 

full-texts, but also an enriched version of publications’ metadata. This 

dataset provides a framework for developing and testing methods and tools 

addressing the workshop topics. The use of this dataset is not mandatory, 

however it is encouraged. 



A new data dump will be made available at http://core.kmi.open.ac.uk/intro/data_dumps shortly. 



4. EXPECTED AUDIENCE



The workshop on Mining Scientific Publications aims to bring together 

researchers, digital library developers and practitioners from government 

and industry to address the current challenges in the domain of mining 

scientific publications.

The 4th Computational Linguistics Scientific Summarization Shared Task, 

CL-SciSumm-18 @ SIGIR 2018: http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cl-scisumm2018/



You are invited to participate in the CL-SciSumm 2018 Shared Task, 

as part of the 3rd Joint Workshop of Bibliometric-enhanced IR and NLP 

for Digital Libraries (BIRNDL) at SIGIR 2018 on Thursday, July 12,  2018.



The 4th CL-SciSumm Shared Task on scientific paper summarization 

follows up on and extends the corpus sizes of the successful Shared Tasks 

conducted as a part of the BIRNDL workshops in 2017, 2016 and 

the Pilot Task conducted as a part of the BiomedSumm Track at the 



Text Analysis Conference 2014. In the CL-SciSumm 2017 Shared Task, 

fifteen teams from six countries signed up, and ten teams ultimately submitted 

and presented their results. The task is run on CL-Scisumm corpus, the largest 

annotated corpus for scientific summarization, comprising over 500 

computational linguistics (CL) research papers, interlinked through a citation 

network. The corpus is available for free download and use 

at https://github.com/WING-NUS/scisumm-corpus. The repository also 

archives all results from all prior runs of the Shared Task.



The Shared Task comprises three sub-tasks in automatic research 

paper summarization on a new corpus of research papers. This task 

is expected to be of interest to a broad community including those 

working in CL and NLP, especially in the sub-disciplines of text 

summarization, natural language generation, text reuse, discourse 

structure in scholarly discourse, paraphrase, textual entailment 

and text simplification.



=== The Task ===



Given: A topic consisting of a Reference Paper (RP) and ten or more



Citing Papers (CPs) that all contain citations to the RP. In each CP,

the text spans (i.e., citances) have been identified that pertain to a

particular citation to the RP.



Task 1a: For each citance, identify the spans of text (cited text

spans) in the RP that most accurately reflect the citance. These are

of the granularity of a sentence fragment, a full sentence, or several

consecutive sentences (no more than 5).



Task 1b: For each cited text span, identify what facet of the paper it

belongs to, from a predefined set of facets.



Evaluation: Task 1 will be scored by overlap of text spans in the

system output vs the gold standard created by human annotators



Task 2: (optional bonus task): Finally, generate a structured summary 

of the RP from the cited text spans of the RP. The length of the summary 

should not exceed 250 words.



Evaluation: Task 2 will be scored using the ROUGE evaluation metric 

to compare automatic summaries against paper abstracts, human 

written summaries and community summaries constructed using 

the output of Task 1a.



=== Important Dates ===



March 19: Training set posted

April 8: Deadline for expression of interest and short system

descriptions due



May 1: Test set posted

May 20: System runs from the test set due

May 27: System reports (paper) due

June 25: Camera ready contributions due

July 12, 2018: Participants present at the BIRNDL 2018 workshop in Ann Arbor, MI, USA



=== The Corpus ===



The CL-SciSumm corpus is created by randomly sampling documents from

the ACL Anthology corpus and selecting their citing papers. Citing paper may 

Include papers from outside the Anthology. For

CL-SciSumm 2018, we have selected three portions of this source

collection to be annotated and serve as training, development and test

collections. The training set of articles is available for download

at GitHub (https://github.com/WING-NUS/scisumm-corpus) and can be used

by participants to pilot their systems.  Watch for updates to the

GitHub repository, as we will be updating the repository with announcements 

and new files. The system outputs from the test set should be submitted to 

the task organizers, for the collation of the final results to be presented at 

the workshop.



=== Registration ===



Organizations wishing to participate in the CL Shared Task track at



BIRNDL 2018 are invited to register on EasyChair:

(https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=birndl2018) by April 8th with 

a tentative abstract. Please prefix “CLSciSumm Shared Task: ” to the 

title of your submission. Participants are advised to register as soon as 

possible in order to receive timely access to evaluation resources, 

including training development and testing data. Registration for the

task does not commit you to participation - but is helpful to know for 

planning. All participants who submit system runs are welcome to 

present their systems as posters/selected presentations at the 

BIRNDL 2018 Workshop at Ann Arbor, MI, USA.

5th International Workshop on Social Media World Sensors

Hof, Germany - 17 September 2019

Held in conjunction with The 30th Conference on Hypertext and Social Media



http://linc.iut.univ-paris8.fr/sideways/



***************



--background--



Nowadays, social platforms have become the most popular communication system all over the world. In fact, due to the short format of messages and the accessibility of these systems, users tend to shift from traditional communication tools (such as blogs, web sites and mailing lists) to social network for various purposes. Billions of messages are appearing daily in these services such as Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, etc. The authors of these messages share content about their private life, exchanging opinions on a variety of topics and discussing a wide range of information news.



--objective--



In light of this, the number of active users is estimated to 1 billion worldwide, which makes these systems the fastest- growing web sites in the world. Even if these system cannot represent an alternative to the authoritative information media, considering the number of its users and the impressive response time of their contributions, they represent a sort of real-time news sensor that can also predate the best newspapers in informing the web community about the emerging topics and trends. In fact, the most important information media always need a certain amount of time to react to a news event; i.e. professional journalists require time, collaborators and/or technology support to provide a professional report. However a user can easily report, in few characters, what is happening in front of the user’s eyes, without any concern about the readers or the writing style. These aspects make social services the most powerful sensor for events detection and automatic news generation. The aim of this workshop is to ask researchers to enter into such view, by studying how Social platforms can be used in a real-time scenario to detect emerging events and enrich them with contextual information like categorization, named entities and relationships with other events and sources of information.





The call for papers will assume the form of a call for surveys and ideas, to motivate researchers to present their view on the current state of the art and the future research challenges. Authors will be thus asked to submit a paper

describing the following points:



1. State of the art survey on the recent literature which can be interpreted as a social-sensor study or analysis

2. Existing research challenges which can be considered as emerging, or completely new challenges that can be proposed in future

research, with their impact on the community

3. A proposed set of features, models, techniques that can be adopted, and the expected results



Papers will be qualitatively evaluated as in a usual reviewing process, but with a particular focus on the clarity of the proposed

survey and the identified research challenges. At conference time, authors will be invited to present their works, and briefly introduce their points of view on the social-sensor current research. Then, an open discussion panel will follow, aiming at fostering new ideas through face to face interactions.

1. Overview

The Semantic Web Challenge on Mining the Web of HTML-embedded Product Data is co-located with the 19th International Semantic Web Conference (https://iswc2020.semanticweb.org/, 2-6 Nov 2020 at Athens, Greece). The challenge organises two shared tasks related to product data mining on the Web: (1) product matching and (2) product classification. This event is organised by The University of Sheffield, The University of Mannheim and Amazon, and is open to anyone. Systems successfully beating the baseline of the respective task, will be invited to write a paper describing their method and system and present the method as a poster (and potentially also a short talk) at the ISWC2020 conference. Winners of each task will be awarded 500 euro as prize (partly sponsored by Peak Indicators, https://www.peakindicators.com/).

4. Task and dataset brief

The challenge organises two tasks, product matching and product categorisation.



i) Product Matching deals with identifying product offers on different websites that refer to the same real-world product (e.g., the same iPhone X model offered using different names/offer titles as well as different descriptions on various websites). A multi-million product offer corpus (16M) containing product offer clusters is released for the generation of training data. A validation set containing 1.1K offer pairs and a test set of 600 offer pairs will also be released. The goal of this task is to classify if the offer pairs in these datasets are match (i.e., referring to the same product) or non-match.



ii) Product classification deals with assigning predefined product category labels (which can be multiple levels) to product instances (e.g., iPhone X is a ‘SmartPhone’, and also ‘Electronics’). A training dataset containing 10K product offers, a validation set of 3K product offers and a test set of 3K product offers will be released. Each dataset contains product offers with their metadata (e.g., name, description, URL) and three classification labels each corresponding to a level in the GS1 Global Product Classification taxonomy. The goal is to classify these product offers into the pre-defined category labels. 



All datasets are built based on structured data that was extracted from the Common Crawl (https://commoncrawl.org/) by the Web Data Commons project (http://webdatacommons.org/). 



5. Resources and tools

The challenge will also release utility code (in Python) for processing the above datasets and scoring the system outputs. In addition, the following language resources for product-related data mining tasks:

A text corpus of 150 million product offer descriptions

Word embeddings trained on the above corpus

Preliminary program is available at http://clc.am/dYWQ5A. More info can be found at the school’s website http://school-raai.org.



The key idea of the school is to combine theory and practice and to attract young students (all levels: under-graduate, graduate, PhDs) to modern academic and business projects in the field of AI. Every day of the school is divided into two parts: lectures about the frontiers of AI delivered by the world-wide experts from academia and practical sessions and workshops from the industrial partners of the school, during which real business cases will be examined and programming competitions (hackatons) held.



We call for papers on young scientists’ ongoing research (either in English or in Russian). Selected papers will be chosen by the program committee for publication. Proceedings in Russian will be published as a book and indexed in RSCI. Proceedings in English are planned to be published by Springer in one of their CS book series. Call for papers can be found on the school’s website.



School’s moto is “Developing Artificial - Don’t Overlook Natural”. We are sure that qualified specialist in the field of AI is not merely a “data scientist” but an interdisciplinary researcher who masters not only the tools of machine learning but methods, models and algorithms of knowledge representation, reasoning, planning etc. This researcher is interested not only in computer science but in the cognitive psychology, neurobiology and other disciplines that might be the source of new ideas for the AI algorithms.



We invite you to participate in RAAI summer school and look forward to seeing you in Moscow, Russia in July 2019!"

The first FAT* conference will be held February 23 and 24th, 2018 at New York University, NYC.   Algorithmic systems are being adopted in a growing number of contexts. Fueled by big data, these systems filter, sort, score, recommend, personalize, and otherwise shape human experiences of socio-technical systems. Although these systems bring myriad benefits, they also contain inherent risks, such as codifying and entrenching biases; reducing accountability and hindering due process; and increasing the information assymmetry between data producers and data holders.



FAT* is an annual conference dedicating to bringing together a diverse community to investigate and tackle issues in this emerging area. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:



* The theory and practice of fair and interpretable Machine Learning, Information Retrieval, NLP, and Computer Vision

* Measurement and auditing of deployed systems

* Users' experience of algorithms, and design interventions to empower users

* The ethical, moral, social, and policy implications of big data and ubiquitous intelligent systems



FAT* builds upon several years of successful workshops on the topics of fairness, accountability, transparency, ethics, and interpretability in machine learning, recommender systems, the web, and other technical disciplines.

Language and Ontologies 2015

Workshop at the 11th International Conference on Computational Semantics (IWCS)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Description

-----------



With the growing importance of Semantic Web technologies, formal ontologies are increasingly used by people with limited or no background in formal logic, creating a significant interest in natural and easily accessible front ends. In addition, the role of ontologies in computational linguistics is recognised as crucial. Global interest in these topics is witnessed by recent projects such as NeOn (Lifecycle Support for Networked Ontologies), LEGO (Lexicon Enhancement via the GOLD Ontology), SWAT (Semantic Web Authoring Tool), PESCaDO (Personalized Environmental Service Configuration and Delivery Orchestration), CO-ODE, and WhatIf (What if... questions for Ontology Authoring).



This workshop aims to create a forum for the many ways in which research on ontologies and research in computational linguistics relate to each other. It aims at bringing together researchers from different communities, including controlled languages and natural language interfaces as well as ontology languages and linguistic ontologies, in order to identify common interests, exploit synergies, and share methods, tools and resources.





Topics of Interest

------------------



* NLP-driven ontology modelling

* Ontology learning and population from text

* Ontology authoring

* Annotation and annotation schemes

* Authoring dialogues

* Psychological studies of errors

* NLP-driven access to ontologies

* Natural language interfaces to ontologies

* Verbalization of ontologies

* Verbalization of query languages

* Ontologies for NLP (e.g. textual entailment, summarisation)

* Ontology-based information retrieval

* Ontologies, folksonomies, and lexicons





Submission Requirements

-----------------------



Papers should be a mamximum of 6 pages long with an additional page allowed for references. 

Papers should be electronically submitted in PDF format via EasyChair (to be arranged). 

Submissions have to be anonymous and follow the IWCS formatting guidelines. 

The deadline for submission is 21st December 2014. 



The accepted papers will be part of the conference proceedings and will be published electronically in the ACL Anthology.

## Overview



The 17th Annual Workshop of the Australian Language Technology Association will be held on the 5th and 6th of December at the University of Technology Sydney, Australia, colocated with the Australian Document Computing Symposium 2019.



The ALTA 2019 workshop is the key local forum for socialising research results in natural language processing and computational linguistics, with presentations and posters from students, industry, and academic researchers. Like previous years, we would also like to encourage submissions and participation from industry and government department researchers and developers.



## Key Dates



 - Submission Deadline:  

         - 19th September, 2019 (long papers)

         - 3rd October, 2019 (short papers and abstracts)

 - Author Notification:  

         - 18th October, 2019 (long papers)

 - Tutorials:              4th December, 2019

 - Main Conference:        5th-6th December, 2019



## Format

We invite submissions of two different formats: (1) Original Research Papers and (2) Abstract-based Presentations.



### (1) Original Research Papers



We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all aspects of natural language processing.



Long papers should be 6-8 pages and short papers should be 3-4 pages. Accepted papers will either be delivered as an oral presentation or as a poster presentation. Both short and long papers may include up to 2 pages of references in addition to the page count requirements.



Note that the review process is double-blind, and accordingly submitted papers should not include the identity of author(s) and the text should be suitably anonymised, e.g. using third person wording for self-citations, not providing URLs to your person website, etc. Original research papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which will be published online in the ACL anthology and the ALTA website. Long papers will be distinguished from short papers in the proceedings.



### (2) Abstract-based Presentations



To encourage broader participation and facilitate local socialisation of international results, we invite 1-2 page presentation abstracts. Submissions should include presentation title and abstract, name of the presenter, any publications relating to the work, and any information on collaboration with the local ALTA community. Abstracts will not be published in the proceedings, but simply reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to ensure that they are on topic, coherent and likely to be of interest to the ALTA community. Abstracts on work in progress and work published or submitted elsewhere are encouraged. ALTA invites submissions of all manner interesting research, not limited to, but including:



- established academics giving an overview of an exciting paper or paper/s published in international venues;

- completing research students giving an overview of their thesis work;

- early candidature research students presenting their work-in-progress and ideas, which may not have been published; and

- industry presenting research and development over linguistic data in the context of their business.



Presentation abstracts should not be anonymised, any publications relating to the work should be cited in the submission, and the person who will give the presentation should be clearly stated.



## Guidelines



Submissions must follow the two-column ACL format. We therefore strongly recommend you use LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word template (found here: http://www.acl2019.org/EN/call-for-papers.xhtml).



## Topics



ALTA invites the submission of papers and presentations on all aspects of natural language processing, including, but not limited to:



- phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse;

- speech understanding and generation;

- interpreting spoken and written language;

- natural language generation;

- linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language;

- NLP-based information extraction and retrieval;

- corpus-based and statistical language modelling;

- machine translation and translation aids;

- question answering and information extraction;

- natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;

- natural language and multimodal systems;

- message and narrative understanding systems;

- evaluations of language systems;

- embodied conversational agents;

- computational lexicography;

- summarisation;

- language resources;

- topic modelling and unsupervised language analysis;

- social media analysis and processing;

- domain-specific adaptation of natural language processing algorithms; and

- applied natural language processing and/or applications in industry.



We particularly encourage submissions that broaden the scope of our community through the consideration of practical applications of language technology and through multi-disciplinary research. We also specifically encourage submissions from industry.



## Multiple Submission Policy



Original research papers that are under review for other publication venues or that you intend to submit elsewhere may be submitted in parallel to ALTA. We require that you declare at submission that your paper is submitted to another venue, and identify the venue. Should your paper be accepted to both ALTA and another venue, we allow you to decide whether the paper should be published in the ALTA proceedings, or if it should be treated as a Presentation (without archival publication). In this case you would still be able to present a research talk at the ALTA workshop. This is to encourage more internationally leading research to be presented at the workshop."

Paper submission: https://www.softconf.com/lrec2014/SaLTMiL/



The 9th International Workshop of the Special Interest Group on Speech and Language Technology for Minority Languages (SaLTMiL) will be held in Reykjavík, Iceland, on May 24, 2014, as part of the 2014 International Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC). (For SALTMIL see: http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/saltmil/); it is also framed as one of the activities of European project Abu-Matran (http://www.abumatran.eu). Entitled ""Free/open-source language resources for the machine translation of less-resourced languages"", the workshop is intended to continue the series of SALTMIL/LREC workshops on computational language resources for minority languages, held in Granada (1998), Athens (2000), Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (2002), Lisbon (2004), Genoa (2006), Marrakech (2008), La Valetta (2010) and Istanbul (2012), and is also expected to attract the audience of Free Rule-Based Machine Translation workshops (2009, 2011, 2012). The workshop aims to share information on language resources, tools and best practice, to save isolated researchers from starting from scratch when building machine translation for a less-resourced language. An important aspect will be the strengthening of the free/open-source language resources community, which can minimize duplication of effort and optimize development and adoption, in line with the LREC 2014 hot topic ‘LRs in the Collaborative Age’ (http://is.gd/LREChot).



The whole-day workshop will consist of short oral papers, a poster session preceded by a poster-boaster session (2 minutes, 2 slides per poster), and a round table.



Papers are invited that describe research and development in the following areas:



    FOS LR for rule-based machine translation (dictionaries, rule sets)

    FOS LR for statistical machine translation (corpora)

    FOS tools to annotate, clean, preprocess, convert, etc. LRs for machine translation

    Machine translation as a tool for creating or enriching FOS LRs for less-resourced languages



Position papers and (web based) demonstrations will also be considered for presentation.



The best papers, as evaluated by the programme committee, will be presented orally and the remaining paper will be presented in poster format.



We expect short papers of max 6,000 words (up to 6 pages) describing research addressing one of the above topics, to be submitted as PDF documents by using the LREC 2014 START conference management system (https://www.softconf.com/lrec2014/SaLTMiL/).



Submissions should be anonymized. When submitting a paper through the START page, authors will be kindly asked to share the resources that have been used for the work described in their paper or that are the outcome of their research. For further information on this initiative, please refer to http://lrec2014.lrec-conf.org/en/calls-for-papers/lrec-2014-special-highlight/.



Submissions of papers should follow the same style as the papers for the main LREC conference (an Author's Kit made of specific guidelines and downloadable templates will be published on the conference web site in due time). All contributions will be included in the workshop proceedings (CD). They will also be published on the SALTMIL website.



The registration fees will be duly announced at the LREC 2014 site. Registration in the workshop willl include a coffee break and the Proceedings of the Workshop. Registration will be handled by the LREC 2014 Secretariat.

About this Workshop

----------------------------------------------------------------------------



Intelligent algorithms for text analytics are the key technology to cope

with the information need challenges in our media-centered society. Methods

for information retrieval and natural language processing receive special

attention, which results from the important role of written text, from the

high availability of the World Wide Web, and from the enormous impact of Web

communities and social media on our life.



The development of advanced text analytics solutions requires the

understanding and the combination of methods from different research areas,

including machine learning, data mining, natural language processing,

artificial intelligence, user interaction and modeling, Web engineering, and

Big Data processing. This workshop pro-vides a platform for presenting and

discussing new solutions, novel ideas, or specific tools in this regard. The

following list organizes classic and recent topics for which contributions

are welcome, but not limited to:



- Theory. Retrieval models, similarity measures, formal analysis



- Evaluation. Corpus construction, experiment design, performance measures

CoNLL-2014 will continue the CoNLL tradition of having a high profile shared task in natural language processing. This year's shared task will be grammatical error correction, a continuation of the CoNLL shared task in 2013. A participating system in this shared task is given short English texts written by non-native speakers of English. The system detects the grammatical errors present in the input texts, and returns the corrected essays. The shared task in 2014 will require a participating system to correct all errors present in an essay (i.e., not restricted to just five error types in 2013). Also, the evaluation metric will be changed to F0.5, weighting precision twice as much as recall.



The grammatical error correction task is impactful since it is estimated that hundreds of millions of people in the world are learning English and they benefit directly from an automated grammar checker. However, for many error types, current grammatical error correction methods do not achieve a high performance and thus more research is needed.



Participating teams will be provided with common training data in which grammatical errors have been annotated. Blind test data will be used to evaluate the outputs of the participating teams using a common scoring software and evaluation metric.



*NEW* Registration



Registration for the shared task has begun. To participate in the shared task, please download the license form for usage of the training data.

*University of Technology Sydney, Australia*

*4th - 6th December 2019*

http://alta2019.alta.asn.au/





## Overview



The 17th Annual Workshop of the Australian Language Technology Association will be held on the 5th and 6th of December at the University of Technology Sydney, Australia, colocated with the Australian Document Computing Symposium 2019.



The ALTA 2019 workshop is the key local forum for socialising research results in natural language processing and computational linguistics, with presentations and posters from students, industry, and academic researchers. Like previous years, we would also like to encourage submissions and participation from industry and government department researchers and developers. 





## Key Dates



 Submission Deadline:    

	 -- 26th September, 2019 (long papers)

	 -- 3rd October, 2019 (short papers and abstracts)

 Author Notification:    

	 -- 18th October, 2019 (long papers)

	 -- 25th October, 2019 (short papers and abstracts)

 Camera-Ready Deadline:  8th November, 2019

 Tutorials:              4th December, 2019

 Main Conference:        5th-6th December, 2019



NOTE: all submission deadlines are midnight UTC -11 (American Samoa)



## Format

We invite submissions of two different formats: (1) Original Research Papers and (2) Abstract-based Presentations.



### (1) Original Research Papers



We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all aspects of natural language processing.



Long papers should be 6-8 pages and short papers should be 3-4 pages. Accepted papers will either be delivered as an oral presentation or as a poster presentation. Both short and long papers may include up to 2 pages of references in addition to the page count requirements.



Note that the review process is double-blind, and accordingly submitted papers should not include the identity of author(s) and the text should be suitably anonymised, e.g. using third person wording for self-citations, not providing URLs to your person website, etc. Original research papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which will be published online in the ACL anthology and the ALTA website. Long papers will be distinguished from short papers in the proceedings.



### (2) Abstract-based Presentations



To encourage broader participation and facilitate local socialisation of international results, we invite 1-2 page presentation abstracts. Accepted abstracts will either be delivered as an oral presentation or as a poster presentation. Submissions should include presentation title and abstract, name of the presenter, any publications relating to the work, and any information on collaboration with the local ALTA community. Abstracts will not be published in the proceedings, but simply reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to ensure that they are on topic, coherent and likely to be of interest to the ALTA community. Abstracts on work in progress and work published or submitted elsewhere are encouraged. ALTA invites submissions of all manner interesting research, not limited to, but including:



- established academics giving an overview of an exciting paper or paper/s published in international venues;

- completing research students giving an overview of their thesis work;

- early candidature research students presenting their work-in-progress and ideas, which may not have been published; and

- industry presenting research and development over linguistic data in the context of their business.



Presentation abstracts should not be anonymised, any publications relating to the work should be cited in the submission, and the person who will give the presentation should be clearly stated.





## Guidelines



Submissions must follow the two-column ACL format. We therefore strongly recommend you use LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word template (found here: http://www.acl2019.org/EN/call-for-papers.xhtml).





## Topics



ALTA invites the submission of papers and presentations on all aspects of natural language processing, including, but not limited to:



- phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse;

- speech understanding and generation;

- interpreting spoken and written language;

- natural language generation;

- linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language;

- NLP-based information extraction and retrieval;

- corpus-based and statistical language modelling;

- machine translation and translation aids;

- question answering and information extraction;

- natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;

- natural language and multimodal systems;

- message and narrative understanding systems;

- evaluations of language systems;

- embodied conversational agents;

- computational lexicography;

- summarisation;

- language resources;

- topic modelling and unsupervised language analysis;

- social media analysis and processing;

- domain-specific adaptation of natural language processing algorithms; and

- applied natural language processing and/or applications in industry.



We particularly encourage submissions that broaden the scope of our community through the consideration of practical applications of language technology and through multi-disciplinary research. We also specifically encourage submissions from industry.





## Multiple Submission Policy



Original research papers that are under review for other publication venues or that you intend to submit elsewhere may be submitted in parallel to ALTA. We require that you declare at submission that your paper is submitted to another venue, and identify the venue. Should your paper be accepted to both ALTA and another venue, we allow you to decide whether the paper should be published in the ALTA proceedings, or if it should be treated as a Presentation (without archival publication). In this case you would still be able to present a research talk at the ALTA workshop. This is to encourage more internationally leading research to be presented at the workshop."

Renowned for their complexity, they are the subject of several studies aimed at their modeling and exploration at all linguistic levels. In the French-speaking research landscape, studies are conducted on very heterogeneous languages ​​in this group, ranging from Southeast Slavic languages ​​(Bulgarian, Macedonian) and Southwestern (BCMS and Slovene) to Slavic languages ​​of the East (Russian, Belarusian, Ukrainian and Ruthenian) and West (Polish, Czech, Slovak, Upper Sorbian and Lower Sorbian). The aim of the workshop we are offering is to bring together NLP researchers with Slavic languages,



We propose to organize this workshop in two distinct parts of 2h00 each with a closing round table. The first section entitled ""Modeling"" aims to bring together papers that revolve around the notion of modeling linguistic data at different levels of analysis (morphological, syntactic, semantic and discursive) with a view to their computer processing. Indeed, we will examine the suitability of modeling and its implementation in automatic processing systems, as well as its applicability to other Slavic languages. The second section entitled ""Resources and applications"" will be devoted to the presentation of applications, tools and resources resulting from modeling.



We are expecting short articles (from 6 to 8 pages including references) or long (from 9 to 12 pages including references) which could deal with the following themes (non-exhaustive list):
 
- contrastive linguistics modeling (between the different Slavic languages ​​or between French and Slavic languages);

-formalization of data of a morphological, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, discursive nature;

- translation problems: divergences and convergences, disambiguation;

- automatic processing: automatic translation, processing of bi- and multilingual data;

- bi- and multilingual tools and databases, parallel corpora, bi- and multilingual lexicons and terminologies.



Articles (short or long) must be between 6 and 12 pages in ATALA format downloadable at the following address: https://taln2015.greyc.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Styles-v1.zip.



Articles must be anonymous (no direct mention of the author or the affiliated institution). The submission is made at the following address: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tasla01"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------



Spoken language translation (SLT) is the science of automatic translation of spoken language.  It may be tempting to view spoken language as nothing more than language (as in text) with an added spoken verbalization preceding it.  Translation of speech could then be achieved by simply applying automatic speech recognition (ASR or “speech-to-text”) before applying traditional machine translation (MT).



Unfortunately, such an overly simplistic approach does not address the complexities of the problem.  Not only do speech recognition errors compound with errors in machine translation, but spoken language also differs considerably in form, structure and style, so as to render the combination of two text-based components as ineffective.  Moreover, automatic spoken language translation systems serve different practical goals than voice interfaces or text translators, so that integrated systems and their interfaces have to be designed carefully and appropriately (mobile, low-latency, audio-visual, online/offline, interactive, etc.) around their intended deployment.



Unlike written texts, human speech is not segmented into sentences, does not contain punctuation, is frequently ungrammatical, contains many disfluencies, or sentence fragments.  Conversely, spoken language contains information about the speaker, gender, emotion, emphasis, social form and relationships and –in the case of dialog- there is discourse structure, turn-taking, back-channeling across languages to be considered.



SLT systems, therefore, need to consider a host of additional concerns related to integrated recognition and translation performance, use of social form and function, prosody, suitability and (depending on deployment) effectiveness of human interfaces, and task performance under various speed, latency, context and language resource constraints.



Due to continuing improvements in underlying spoken language ASR and MT components as well as in the integrated system designs, spoken language systems have become increasingly sophisticated and can handle increasingly complex sentences, more natural environments, discourse and conversational styles, leading to a variety of successful practical deployments. 



In the light of 25 years of successful research and transition into practice, the MT Journal dedicates a special issue to the problem of Spoken Language Translation.  We invite submissions of papers that address issues and problems pertaining to the development, design and deployment of spoken language translation systems.  Papers on component technologies and methodology as well as on system designs and deployments of spoken language systems are both encouraged.

OVERVIEW



This year's workshop will feature five shared tasks:



    a translation task,

    a (pilot) automatic post-editing task (NEW),

    a tuning task (optimize a given MT system, NEW, a follow-up of the WMT11 tunable metrics task),

    a quality estimation task (assess MT quality without access to any reference),

    a metrics task (assess MT quality given reference translation). 



In addition to the shared tasks, the workshop will also feature scientific papers on topics related to MT. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:



    word-based, phrase-based, syntax-based, semantics-based SMT

    using comparable corpora for SMT

    incorporating linguistic information into SMT

    decoding

    system combination

    error analysis

    manual and automatic method for evaluating MT

    scaling MT to very large data sets



We encourage authors to evaluate their approaches to the above topics using the common data sets created for the shared tasks.



TRANSLATION TASK



The first shared task which will examine translation between the following language pairs:



    English-German and German-English

    English-French and French-English

    English-Finnish and Finnish-English NEW

    English-Czech and Czech-English

    English-Russian and Russian-English



The text for all the test sets will be drawn from news articles except for (NEW) the French-English set, which will be drawn from user-generated comments on the news articles. Participants may submit translations for any or all of the language directions. In addition to the common test sets the workshop organizers will provide optional training resources, including a newly expanded release of the Europarl corpora and out-of-domain corpora.



All participants who submit entries will have their translations evaluated. We will evaluate translation performance by human judgment. To facilitate the human evaluation we will require participants in the shared tasks to manually judge some of the submitted translations. For each team, this will amount to ranking 300 sets of 5 translations, per language pair submitted.



We also provide baseline machine translation systems, with performance comparable to the best systems from last year's shared task.

AUTOMATIC POST-EDITING TASK



This shared task will examine automatic methods for correcting errors produced by machine translation (MT) systems. Automatic Post-editing (APE) aims at improving MT output in black box scenarios, in which the MT system is used ""as is"" and cannot be modified. From the application point of view APE components would make it possible to:



    Cope with systematic errors of an MT system whose decoding process is not accessible

    Provide professional translators with improved MT output quality to reduce (human) post-editing effort



In this first edition of the task, the evaluation will focus on one language pair (English-Spanish), measuring systems' capability to reduce the distance (HTER) that separates an automatic translation from its human-revised version approved for publication. Training and test data are provided by Unbabel.

QUALITY ESTIMATION TASK



Quality estimation systems aim at producing an estimate on the quality of a given translation at system run-time, without access to a reference translation. This topic is particularly relevant from a user perspective. Among other applications, it can (i) help decide whether a given translation is good enough for publishing as is; (ii) filter out sentences that are not good enough for post-editing; (iii) select the best translation among options from multiple MT and/or translation memory systems; (iv) inform readers of the target language of whether or not they can rely on a translation; and (v) spot parts (words or phrases) of a translation that are potentially incorrect.



Research on this topic has been showing promising results in the last couple of years. Building on the last three years' experience, the Quality-Estimation track of the WMT15 workshop and shared-task will focus on English, Spanish and German as languages and provide new training and test sets, along with evaluation metrics and baseline systems for variants of the task at three different levels of prediction: word, sentence, and document.

METRICS TASK

The metrics task (also called evaluation task) will assess automatic evaluation metrics' ability to:



    Rank systems on their overall performance on the test set

    Rank systems on a sentence by sentence level



Participants in the shared evaluation task will use their automatic evaluation metrics to score the output from the translation task and the tunable metrics task. In addition to MT outputs from the other two tasks, the participants will be provided with reference translations. We will measure the correlation of automatic evaluation metrics with the human judgments.

TUNING TASK

In the tuning task is a follow up of WMT11 invitation-only tunable metrics task. The task will assess your team's ability to optimize the parameters of a given hierarchical MT system (Moses).



Participants in the tuning task will be given complete Moses models for English-to-Czech and Czech-to-English translation and the standard developments sets from the translation task. The participants are expected to submit the moses.ini for one or both of the translation directions. We will use the configuration and a fixed revision of Moses to translate official WMT15 test set. The outputs of the various configurations of the system will be scored using the standard manual evaluation procedure.

PAPER SUBMISSION INFORMATION



Submissions will consist of regular full papers of 6-10 pages, plus additional pages for references, formatted following the EMNLP 2015 guidelines. In addition, shared task participants will be invited to submit short papers (4-6 pages) describing their systems or their evaluation metrics. Both submission and review processes will be handled electronically. Note that regular papers must be anonymized, while system descriptions do not need to be.



We encourage individuals who are submitting research papers to evaluate their approaches using the training resources provided by this workshop and past workshops, so that their experiments can be repeated by others using these publicly available corpora.

POSTER FORMAT

The posters will be attached to self standing posterboards measuring 3 ft high and 4 ft wide and sitting on top of tables so there will be laptop/handout space as well. We will provide pushpins, double-sided tape, that putty-like substance, and clips to affix the posters to the posterboards."

= ABSTRACTS AND PAPER SUBMISSION INFORMATION =



We will be accepting submissions online via START. The abstract submission deadline for both long and short papers is May 15, 2019, and the paper submission deadline for long and short papers is May 21, 2019.



EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 uses a double-blind review process. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.



[Long papers]



EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 long paper submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. Each long paper submission consists of a paper of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references; final versions of long papers will be given one additional page (up to nine pages with unlimited pages for references) so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.



[Short papers]



EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 also solicits short papers. Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. While a short paper is not a shortened long paper, the characteristics of short papers include: a small, focused contribution; work in progress; a negative result; an opinion piece; an interesting application nugget. Each short paper submission consists of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references; final versions of short papers will be given one additional page (up to five pages in the proceedings and unlimited pages for references) so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account. Each short paper submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.



[IMPORTANT: Anonymity Period]



EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 adopts ACL’s new policies for submission, review, and citation. Submissions that violate any of these policies will be rejected without review.



Most importantly, the policies define an anonymity period, which starts on April 21, 2019 (11:59pm PDT).



You may not make a non-anonymized version of your paper available to the general community (for example, by posting it on your home page or submitting it to arXiv) during the anonymity period. However, you may take such an action before the anonymity period begins, even if the paper actually becomes public after the anonymity period begins (for example, because arXiv makes papers public one or two days after receiving them).



You may not update a non-anonymized version during the anonymity period, and we ask you not to advertise it on social media or take other actions that would further compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period.



You may make an anonymized version of your paper available, even during the anonymity period (for example, on OpenReview).



During the anonymity period, you may not update a non-anonymized version, advertise an anonymized or non-anonymized version on social media, or take any other action that would compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period.



For the background of the new policies, refer to the online version.



[Instructions for Double-Blind Review]



To ensure anonymity, submissions and supplementary materials must not include the authors’ names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author’s identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …”, should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith (1991) previously showed …”. Acknowledgments of funding or assistance must also be omitted. Submissions should not contain pointers to supplemental information on the web; any such material should be submitted as supplementary materials (see above). Submissions that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. Separate author identification information is required as part of the online submission process.



[Multiple Submission Policy]



EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 will not consider any paper that is under review in a journal or another conference at the time of submission. Neither will the conference consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. In addition, authors may not submit the paper elsewhere during EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019's review period. Authors submitting more than one paper to EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 must ensure that the submissions do not overlap significantly ()25%) with each other in content or results.



[Formatting Requirements]



Both long and short papers must follow the EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 two-column format. Please do not modify these style files, or use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.





Links to EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 paper templates will follow soon.





[Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data]



Each EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 submission can be accompanied by a single PDF appendix, one one .tgz or .zip archive containing software, and one .tgz or .zip archive containing data. EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 encourages the submission of these supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results, and to enable authors to provide additional information that does not fit in the paper. For example, preprocessing decisions, model parameters, feature templates, lengthy proofs or derivations, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of the work described in the paper can be put into the appendix. However, the paper submissions need to remain fully self-contained, as these supplementary materials are completely optional, and reviewers are not even asked to review or download them. If the pseudo-code or derivations or model specifications are an important part of the contribution, or if they are important for the reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work, they should be a part of the main paper, and not appear in the appendix. Supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.





= PRESENTATION REQUIREMENT =



All accepted papers must be presented at the conference in order to appear in the proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019. Accepted papers will be presented orally or as a poster (at the discretion of the program chairs based on the nature rather than the quality of the work). There will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally or as posters.





= FURTHER INFORMATION =



The conference website will continue to be updated with information on workshops, tutorials, the conference venue, traveling, etc.

Call for papers

---------------



This panel at ISHS 2018 solicits abstract submissions on the implementation of humor detection and generation systems in artificial intelligence environments.



Humor as a universal and ubiquitously used human ability has proven to be among the hardest to simulate in these environments. But progress is continuous and should be reported on at the most important international conference on humor. The main field contributing to humor and AI is natural language processing (computational linguistics), where currently deep learning methods are de rigueur. But these are more successful at visual processing than symbolic systems, which are the basis of humor. Simpler tasks, like template-based joke generation and rule-based or machine-learned joke detection, are seeing more recent advances. Beyond these narrower approaches, any researcher in artificial intelligence and humor from any field should feel welcome to this panel.

For this reason, we also invite work that has been, or will be, published elsewhere, as long as this is compatible with the conditions of the publisher. 



A special issue of the Northern European Journal of Language Technology (NEJLT) will be dedicated to the conference. This issue will solicit full-length versions of the conference papers, and will have a separate review process. The corresponding call for papers will be made shortly after SLTC, so that feedback given during the conference can be incorporated into the journal versions. 



Submission 

Papers must be submitted as extended abstracts using the style files provided, and should include author names and affiliations. The traditional length of SLTC abstracts are 2 pages, but we allow abstracts of up to 4 pages if it benefits the presentation. Papers must be submitted via the online paper submission system. Information on the paper submission procedure is available at the conference webpage: sltc2016.cs.umu.se 



Deadline 

The deadline for submission is 10 September, 2016. 



Review 

Papers will be reviewed by the program committee. Authors will be notified 1 October, 2016.

The specific characteristics of biomedical and clinical text motivate the need to develop specialised NLP and text mining methods, or to adapt or reengineer existing tools. Most such techniques will be reliant on access to one or more resources that provide information about domain-specific language usage, thus highlighting their central role. Accordingly, it is important to provide fora in which the current state of the art of such resources, as well as the NLP and text mining tools that make use of them, can be evaluated and discussed. 



Since 2008, the biennial Workshops on Building and Evaluating Resources for Biomedical Text Mining have allowed dissemination of current developments in the field, and have provided the opportunity to discuss current problems, ideas, questions and open issues, and to understand current and potential uses of resources. 



The fifth workshop in this series (BioTxtM 2016) will once again aim to bring together researchers who have developed or evaluated NLP tools and resources for biomedical or clinical applications (e.g., text mining, multilingual search, machine translation, information extraction, question-answering), as well as domain experts/health professionals who use or would benefit from the use of such resources and tools. By complementing traditional presentations with a focussed discussion session and, for the first time, a shared task sessions, the workshop aims to stimulate novel research efforts and collaborations between researchers and professionals with complementary knowledge and skills. We particularly welcome submissions that handle languages other than English, or which facilitate multilingual access to information.



TOPICS OF INTEREST

We invite papers reporting on tools and resources that support the application of NLP and text mining to various textual biomedical and clinical information sources in different languages. The workshop will focus on the resources themselves, as well as on issues relating to their usability (e.g., design guidelines, standards for building resources, storage and exchange formats, interoperability issues, evaluation, etc.) and on the different ways in which they are being employed by applications and tools to facilitate information access. 

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

- NLP and text mining tools for biomedical or clinical applications

- Design and construction of biomedical and clinical resources for various languages: controlled vocabularies, terminologies, ontologies, corpora, multi-lingual resources

- Semi-automatic and/or collaborative methods for the update, evolution, extension or enrichment of resources

- Evaluation and comparison of tools and resources

- Adaptation of tools and resources to new sub-domains, text types or languages

- Interoperability of resources and standards

- Tools for the exploration of resources

Long and Short Papers

--------------------------------------------



Long Papers



Long paper submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and

unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis

should be included.



Long paper submissions may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus

unlimited references; final versions of long papers will be given one

additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers,F"" (Bcomments can

be taken into account.



Long papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the

program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally

and which as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than

the quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings

between long papers presented orally and as posters.





Short Papers



Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please

note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers

should have a point that can be made in a few pages. Some kinds of short

papers are:

- A small, focused contribution

- Work in progress

- A negative result

- An opinion piece

- An interesting application nugget



Short paper submissions may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus

unlimited references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given five (5)

content pages in the proceedings. Authors are encouraged to use this

additional page to address reviewers,F""(B comments in their final versions.



Short papers will be presented in one or more oral or poster sessions. While

short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings,

there will be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers

presented orally and as posters.





Submission Guideline

-----------------------------------------

Note: the ACL is creating expanded publication guidelines which will be made

available via the NAACL-HLT 2018 website and submission system when they are

available. The ACL publication guidelines will supersede the guidelines

below in case of conflict.



Submissions should be original



The content of submissions to NAACL-HLT 2018 (the ideas, the findings, the

results and the words) should be original; that is, should not have been

published (or be accepted for publication) in another refereed, archival

form (such as a book, a journal, or a conference proceedings).



Authors may present preliminary versions of their work in other venues that

are not refereed and/or not archival (e.g. course reports, theses,

non-archival workshops, or on preprint servers such as arXiv.org). Authors

should list all such previous presentations in the submission form. This

will help the area chairs if questions of originality arise.



Papers that have been or will be submitted to other venues must indicate

this at submission time, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if

accepted to NAACL-HLT 2018.



Authors submitting more than one paper to NAACL-HLT 2018 must ensure that the

submissions do not overlap significantly (25%) with each other.





Facilitate double blind review



Double blind review is a form of peer review in which the identities of

authors are not provided to reviewers, and the identities of reviewers are

not provided to authors. To facilitate double blind review, submissions

should not identify authors or their affiliations. For example,

self-references that reveal the author,F""(Bs identity, e.g., ,F4(BWe previously

showed (Smith, 1991) $(B!D,F!(B must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as

,F4(BSmith previously showed (Smith, 1991) $(B!D,F!(B. Any preliminary non-archival

versions of submitted papers should be listed in the submission form but not

in the review version of the paper. NAACL-HLT 2018 reviewers are generally

aware that authors may present preliminary versions of their work in other

venues, but will not be provided the list of previous presentations from the

submission form.





Follow style and format guidelines



Submissions should follow the NAACL-HLT 2018 style guidelines. Long paper

submissions must follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings without

exceeding eight (8) pages of content. Short paper submissions must also

follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings, and must not exceed four

(4) pages. References do not count against these limits. We strongly

recommend the use of the official NAACL-HLT 2018 style templates. All

submissions must in PDF format. Submissions that do not adhere to the above

author guidelines may be rejected without review.





Presentation Requirement



All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the

proceedings. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at NAACL-HLT 2018

must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to whether

the paper will be presented.



Previous presentations of the work (e.g. preprints on arXiv.org) should be

indicated in a footnote that should be excluded from the review submission,

but included in the final version of papers appearing in the NAACL-HLT 2018

proceedings.



At least one author of each accepted paper must register for NAACL-HLT 2018

by the early registration deadline.





Paper Online Submission



Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management

system at:

https://www.softconf.com/naacl2018/papers for long papers

https://www.softconf.com/naacl2018/shortpapers for short papers

CALL FOR PAPERS 

=======================



The 10th Linguistic Annotation Workshop (The LAW X)

http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/conf/law-x-2016



Held in conjunction with ACL/HLT 2016, Berlin/Germany, August 2016

Sponsored by the ACL Special Interest Group on Annotation (SIGANN)







WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION 

========================



Linguistic annotation of natural language corpora is the backbone of supervised methods for statistical natural language processing. It also provides valuable data for evaluation of both rule-based and supervised systems and can help formalize and study linguistic phenomena. 



The LAW provides a forum for presentation and discussion of innovative research on all aspects of linguistic annotation, including creation/evaluation of annotation schemes, methods for automatic and manual annotation, use and evaluation of annotation software and frameworks, representation of linguistic data and annotations, evaluation of manual and automatically-produced annotations, etc. 





SPECIAL THEME

=======================

We encourage submission of papers relating to this year's theme: Evaluation of Annotation Quality.



This special theme considers current practice in evaluation of linguistic annotations and its successes and failures by asking questions such as: How are we as a community measuring inter-annotator agreement to date, and are there sounder ways to measure it? How can we estimate the annotation quality of existing resources, and what can be done to document annotated data to help others assess its reliability? 



We encourage submissions addressing the following topics related to the special theme:

How agreement is measured in various (new or existing) annotation projects, and what the different scores tell us in each case. 

Good acceptance thresholds for different annotation tasks and metrics, and/or how to determine them.

Previously proposed but not widely used measures for agreement or annotation quality.

Proposals for quantitative or qualitative methods to measure agreement or annotation quality.

Proposals for documentation of published resources to support their evaluation, means and methods to achieve community evaluation of linguistically-annotated resources, etc.





WORKSHOP TOPICS

=======================

We welcome submissions of long and short papers, posters, and demonstrations, relating to the topics of the special theme and to any aspect of linguistic annotation, including:        



== Annotation procedures ==

- Innovative automated and manual strategies for annotation.

- Machine learning and knowledge-based methods for automation of corpus annotation.

- Creation, maintenance, and interactive exploration of annotation structures and annotated data.



== Annotation evaluation ==

- Inter-annotator agreement and other evaluation metrics and strategies.

- Qualitative evaluation of linguistic representation.



== Annotation access and use ==

- Representation formats/structures for merged annotations of different phenomena, and means to explore/manipulate them.

- Linguistic considerations for merging annotations of distinct phenomena.



== Annotation schemes, guidelines and standards ==

- New and innovative annotation schemes, comparison of annotation schemes.

- Best practices for annotation procedures and/or development and documentation of annotation schemes.

- Interoperability of annotation formats and/or frameworks among different systems as well as different tasks, frameworks, modalities, and languages.

- Results on the application and evaluation of standards for (linguistic) annotation.



== Annotation software and frameworks ==

- Development, evaluation and/or innovative use of annotation software frameworks.





SUBMISSIONS and REVIEWING

=========================



Submissions should report original and unpublished research on topics of interest for the workshop. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop, and will be published in the workshop proceedings. They should emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results.



A paper accepted for presentation at the workshop must not be or have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings.



The maximum length is eight (8) pages of content for long papers and four (4) pages of content for short papers, posters, and demonstrations, plus up to two (2) pages of references.

Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore, the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations or self-references that reveal the authors’ identity, e.g., ""We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."" should be replaced with citations such as ""Smith (1991) previously showed ..."". Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

Authors of papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must provide this information to the workshop co-chairs (law-x-2016@coli.uni-saarland.de). Authors of accepted papers must notify the program chairs within 10 days of acceptance if the paper is withdrawn for any reason.



If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the program co-chairs (law-x-2016@coli.uni-saarland.de).

Description



Machine comprehension of Evaluative, Affective and Subjective (EAS) language on par with human understanding requires identification and understanding fine grained emotions, beliefs, opinions, and judgements expressed in language both implicitly and explicitly. The goal of this workshop is to focus the attention of the NLP research community on combining deep learning/statistical NLP techniques with richer/deeper semantic representations driven by computational linguistics in analysing and understanding EAS text. This workshop is intended to throw down the gauntlet to the NLP community both in the computational linguistics camp and the machine learning camp, to achieve human-level understanding of EAS language.



We invite the NLP research community to explore approaches going beyond bag of words and bag of sentences by combining higher level linguistic insights including discourse level information, pragmatics and other contextual information along with statistical data driven techniques, for better understanding of EAS text. Approaches which explore linguistic phenomena such as figurative language, intent detection as well as the use of extra-linguistic information in terms of the socio-cultural origins of the text, social network structure origins of the text, and author social network profiles in understanding EAS text would also be of interest. We are also interested in non-trivial EAS text applications which go beyond mere identification of evaluative, emotive, subjective cue phrases to underlying causative events/reasons/arguments which give rise to these emotions/feelings/beliefs/subjective opinions. Non-trivial benchmarks for comparing machine comprehension of EAS aspects with human understanding are also welcome.



Topics of interest





Topics of interest include but are not limited to:



·         richer/deeper linguistic representations of aspects of EAS



·         understanding of cognitive processing of EAS language



·         extra-linguistic aspects of EAS language



·         socio-cultural aspects of EAS language



·         psycholinguistic aspects of EAS text analysis



·         interpretability of deep learning-based EAS analysis systems



·         identifying origins/dynamic contexts/causative events/reasons in EAS text analysis (including the fields of stance detection, subjective judgements/beliefs detection, argumentation in both emotive and evaluative texts).





Submission Requirements



We solicit both long and short paper submissions. All papers must describe substantial, original, and unpublished work. Submissions will be judged on appropriateness, clarity, originality/innovativeness, correctness/soundness, meaningful comparison, thoroughness, significance, contributions to research resources, and replicability. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.



Both long and short papers must follow the two-column format of EACL 2017. For the original submission, long papers may be up to eight (8) pages in length plus unlimited pages of references, whereas short papers may be up to four (4) pages in length plus unlimited pages of references. Both long and short papers will be given one additional page of content for the camera-ready version.



Papers will be presented orally or as posters, as determined by the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and which as posters will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and as posters.



As the reviewing will be blind, papers must not include authors’ names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author’s identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith (1991) previously showed …” Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.



Papers that have only appeared on preprint servers such as arXiv.org, do not count as previously published, and may be submitted to the workshop. Note that the version submitted for review must be suitably anonymized, and should not contain references to the prior non-archival version.

Call For Papers



WSDM PrivateNLP is a full day workshop taking place on Monday, February 7, 2020 in conjunction with WSDM 2020 in Houston, Texas.



Workshop website: https://sites.google.com/view/wsdm-privatenlp-2020



Important Dates:



• Submission Deadline: December 15, 2019

• Acceptance Notification: January 4, 2020

• Poster / extended abstract deadline: January 10, 2020

• Camera-ready versions: January 20, 2020

• Workshop: February 7, 2020



Privacy-preserving data analysis has become essential in the age of Machine Learning (ML) where access to vast amounts of data can provide gains over tuned algorithms. A large proportion of user-contributed data comes from natural language e.g., text transcriptions from voice assistants.



It is therefore important to curate NLP datasets while preserving the privacy of the users whose data is collected, and train ML models that only retain non-identifying user data.



The workshop aims to bring together practitioners and researchers from academia and industry to discuss the challenges and approaches to designing, building, verifying, and testing privacy preserving systems in the context of Natural Language Processing. 



Topics of interest include but are not limited to:



* Generating privacy preserving test sets

* Inference and identification attacks

* Generating Differentially private derived data

* NLP, privacy and regulatory compliance

* Private Generative Adverserial Networks

* Privacy in Active Learning and Crowdsourcing

* Privacy and Federated Learning in NLP

* User perceptions on privatized personal data

* Auditing  provenance in language models 

* Continual learning under privacy constraints

* NLP and summarization of privacy policies

* Ethical ramifications of AI/NLP in support of usable privacy





Submission Instructions:



All submissions will be double-blind peer reviewed (with author names and affiliations removed) by the program committee and judged by their relevance to the workshop themes. All submissions must be in English, formatted according to the latest 2 column ACM SIG proceedings template.



Submitted manuscripts must be 8 pages long for full papers, and 4 pages long for short papers. Both full and short papers can have 2 additional pages for references and appendices. Extended abstracts / posters must be 2 pages. Please note that at least one of the authors of each accepted paper must register for the workshop and present the paper in-person.

The recurring translation task of the WMT workshops focuses mainly on European language pairs, but this year we have introduced English-Hindi as an experimental, low resource language pair. Translation quality will be evaluated on a shared, unseen test set of news stories. We provide a parallel corpus as training data, a baseline system, and additional resources for download. Participants may augment the baseline system or use their own system.



GOALS



The goals of the shared translation task are:



To investigate the applicability of current MT techniques when translating into languages other than English

To examine special challenges in translating between European languages, including word order differences and morphology

To investigate the translation of low-resource, morphologically rich languages

To create publicly available corpora for machine translation and machine translation evaluation

To generate up-to-date performance numbers for European languages in order to provide a basis of comparison in future research

To offer newcomers a smooth start with hands-on experience in state-of-the-art statistical machine translation methods

We hope that both beginners and established research groups will participate in this task.

TASK DESCRIPTION



We provide training data for five language pairs, and a common framework (including a baseline system). The task is to improve methods current methods. This can be done in many ways. For instance participants could try to:



improve word alignment quality, phrase extraction, phrase scoring

add new components to the open source software of the baseline system

augment the system otherwise (e.g. by preprocessing, reranking, etc.)

build an entirely new translation systems

Participants will use their systems to translate a test set of unseen sentences in the source language. The translation quality is measured by a manual evaluation and various automatic evaluation metrics. Participants agree to contribute to the manual evaluation about eight hours of work.

You may participate in any or all of the following language pairs:



French-English

Hindi-English

German-English

Czech-English

Russian-English

For all language pairs we will test translation in both directions. To have a common framework that allows for comparable results, and also to lower the barrier to entry, we provide a common training set and baseline system.

We also strongly encourage your participation, if you use your own training corpus, your own sentence alignment, your own language model, or your own decoder.



If you use additional training data or existing translation systems, you must flag that your system uses additional data. We will distinguish system submissions that used the provided training data (constrained) from submissions that used significant additional data resources. Note that basic linguistic tools such as taggers, parsers, or morphological analyzers are allowed in the constrained condition.



Your submission report should highlight in which ways your own methods and data differ from the standard task. We may break down submitted results in different tracks, based on what resources were used. We are mostly interested in submission that are constraint to the provided training data, so that the comparison is focused on the methods, not on the data used. You may submit contrastive runs to demonstrate the benefit of additional training data."

This area of research has been constantly gaining momentum and attention over the past few years as textual material become available in abundance (social networks and web content) and advanced computational power become accessible. This resulted in an interesting array of practical applications. This is evident in the number of conferences, conference tracks, workshops, special issues of journals dedicated to or issues related to ANLP. Another indication of this growing interest is the surge of papers, books, and other forms of publications related to NLP. Noticeably, deep learning is dominating NLP as it did to other areas of artificial intelligence. Deep learning is the modern application of earlier neural network technology but with multiple layers that made possible with modern computing technology. The application of deep learning technology to NLP is progressing at a fast pace, and it is anticipated that we will see many exciting new discoveries here in the next few years. Therefore, the objective of this workshop is to present current and future advances in NLP. Authors are encouraged to submit their original work, which is not submitted elsewhere, to this workshop.

Tutorials: 4 December 2013

Workshop: 5-6 December 2013

Brisbane, Queensland, Australia



This year the Australasian Language Technology Workshop (ALTA) will be

held at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Queensland,

Australia on Wednesday 4 December - Friday 6 December. This event will

be the eleventh annual instalment of the ALTA Workshop in its current

incarnation, and the continuation of an annual workshop series that has

existed under various guises since the early 90s. The meeting returns to

Australia after a successful international event in Dunedin, New Zealand

in 2012.



The goals of the ALTA workshop are:



    -to bring together the growing Language Technology (LT) community

    in the Australasian region and encourage interactions;

    -to encourage interactions and collaboration within this community

    and with the wider international LT community;

    -to foster interaction between academic and industrial

    researchers, to encourage dissemination of research results;

    -to provide a forum for students and young researchers to present

    their research;

    -to facilitate the discussion of new and ongoing research and

     projects;

    -to provide an opportunity for the broader artificial intelligence

    community to become aware of local LT research; and, finally,

    -to increase visibility of LT research in Australasia and

     overseas.

				   RELATIONS 

			Workshop on meaning relations 

			between phrases and sentences



Website

https://sites.google.com/view/relations-2019



Description

The RELATIONS workshop invites submissions of long and short papers

on substantial, original, and unpublished research focusing on

comparing the meaning of linguistic expressions such as phrases,

clauses, sentences, and paragraphs. We are interested in both:

theoretical research on the nature of meaning relations and the

empirical work on identifying, generating, and extracting them. We

also invite submissions studying the impact of the relations in

downstream applications.





Topics

Examples for meaning relations of interest are:

Synonymy/Paraphrase (Phrases/sentences having approx. the same

meaning)

Entailment (One phrase/sentence being inferred from another)

Specificity (One phrase/sentence being more general than another)

Similarity (Phrases/sentences with a partial meaning overlap) 



Topics of interest wrt. meaning relations include, but are not

limited to:

Annotating meaning relations

Resources for meaning relations

Applications making use of meaning relations

Transfer Learning between meaning relations

Evaluation frameworks or metrics for meaning relations

Meaning representation models and their connection with meaning

relations (symbolic as well as statistical approaches)

Theoretical research on the nature of the meaning relations e.g. a

typology, or a comparison of several relations



Important Dates

Submission deadline (tentative): March 07

Author notification: April 07

Camera ready: April 20

Workshop: May 23

Note: All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (""anywhere on Earth"")



Submission and Reviewing

Papers should be submitted electronically via EasyChair. The

submission site will be announced shortly.  Each paper will be

reviewed by at least two members of the Program Committee.  Accepted

papers are expected to be presented at the workshop and will be

published in the workshop proceedings.

Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore, the paper must

not include the authors' names and affiliations or self-references

that reveal the authors’ identity--e.g., ""We previously showed

(Smith, 1991) ..."" should be replaced with citations such as ""Smith

(1991) previously showed ..."". Papers that do not conform to these

requirements will be rejected without review.



Dual Submission Policy

Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or

publications must indicate this at submission time. Authors of papers

accepted for presentation at RELATIONS 2019 must notify the program

chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper will be

presented. All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to

appear in the proceedings. We will not accept for publication or

presentation papers that overlap significantly in content or results

with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere.

All submissions should comply with the recent ACL policies on

Submission, Review and Citation. The authors are strongly encouraged

to check those here before submitting their paper.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





AIMS AND SCOPE

--------------------------



The 2nd edition of the RDSM workshop will particularly focus on online information disorder and its interplay with public opinion formation. Information disorder has been categorised into three types: (1) misinformation, an honest mistake in information sharing, (2) disinformation, deliberate spreading of inaccurate information, and (3) malinformation, accurate information that is intended to harm others, such as leaks. The spread of this information can play an important role in shaping public opinion, as well as the formation of public opinion can feed back into the production and sharing of information disorder.



The challenges posed by online information disorder and its ability to shape public opinion has evoked the occurrence of important political phenomena of worldwide impact in recent events. This is the case of recent political events such as Brexit and Trump’s election, where social media played a significant role in shaping public opinion and issues now known as “fake news” and “post-truth” had an impact that is yet to be understood.



It is a fact that social media is an excellent resource of mining all kind of information varying from opinions to actual facts. However, it is also fact that not all pieces of information are reliable and thus their truth is highly questionable. One such category of information types are rumours where the veracity level is not known at the time of posting. Although rumours can be true many of them are classified as false and such false rumours are a powerful tool used to manipulate public opinion. It is therefore very important to detect and verify false rumours before they are spread and influence the public opinion. In this workshop the aim is to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in social media mining and analysis to deal with the emerging issues of rumour veracity assessment and manipulation of public opinion.

The 1st International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Informal Text  (NLPIT 2015)

In conjunction with The International Conference on Web Engineering(ICWE 2015)

June 23, 2015, Rotterdam, The Netherlands

http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~badiehm/nlpit2015/

###############################################################################################

Overview

###########

The rapid growth of Internet usage in the last two decades adds new challenges to understand the informal user generated content (UGC) on the Internet. Textual UGC refers to textual posts on social media, blogs, emails, chat conversations, instant messages, forums, reviews, or advertisements that are created by end-users of an online system. A large portion of language used on textual UGC is informal. Informal text is the style of writing that disregard language grammars and uses a mixture of abbreviations and context dependent terms. The straightforward application of state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing approaches on informal text typically results in significantly degraded performance due to the following reasons: the lack of sentence structure; the lack of enough context required; the seldom entities involved; the noisy sparse contents of users' contributions; and the untrusted facts contained. It is the aim of this work- shop to bring the attention of researchers to the opportunities and challenges involved in informal text processing. In particular, we are interested in discussing informal text modeling, normalization, mining, and understanding in addition to various application areas in which UGC is involved.



Topics

###########

We invite submissions on topics that include, but are not limited to, the following core NLP approaches for informal UGC: language identification, classification, clustering, filtering, summarization, tokenization, segmentation, morphological analysis, POS tagging, parsing, named entity extraction, named entity disambiguation, relation/fact extraction, semantic annotation, sentiment analysis, language normalization, informality modeling and measuring, language generation, handling uncertainties, machine translation, ontology construction, dictionary construction, etc.



Submission

###########

Authors are invited to submit original work not submitted to another conference or workshop. Workshop submissions could be a full paper or short paper. Paper length should not exceed 12 pages for full papers and 6 pages for short papers. All papers should follow the Springer's LNCS format. Papers in PDF can be sent via the EasyChair Conference System https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nlpit2015. Each submission will receive, in addition to a meta-review, at least 2 peer double-blind reviews. Each full paper will get 25 minutes presentation time. Short papers will get 5 minutes presentation time in addition to a poster. Beside papers, we also plan to have an invited talk by a renowned scientist on a topic relevant for the workshop. Workshop proceedings will be published as part of the ICWE2015 workshop proceedings. To contact the NLPIT 2015 organization team, please send an e-mail to: nlpit2015@easychair.org.

Keynote Speech

###############

-Speaker: Nathan Schneider



-Title: Hacking a Way Through the Twitter Language Jungle: Syntactic Annotation, Tagging, and Parsing of English Tweets. 



-Abstract: Diverse genres of digital text are forcing us to rethink our modus operandi in NLP: with a Web awash in natural language text from ordinary users, it is not enough to be able to analyze well-edited news sentences. To build tools that are accurate for other linguistic styles, we need new linguistic resources. Unfortunately, traditional forms of syntactic analysis are expensive and do not readily adapt to informal genres. This talk plunges into parsing in the Twitter jungle, following a trajectory that tightly integrates linguistic data preparation and statistical modeling. I argue against treating traditional linguistic representations as sacrosanct, and instead present new representations that are simpler and more flexible for conversational text. Taking advantage of these for a streamlined annotation process, I and colleagues at CMU have compiled datasets of tweets and built domain-appropriate POS taggers and parsers (Gimpel et al., ACL 2011; Owoputi et al., NAACL 2013; Schneider et al., LAW 2013; Kong et al., EMNLP 2014). Would-be Twitter trailblazers are invited to plunder these resources, which are stashed at http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/TweetNLP/.



-Bio: Nathan Schneider is an annotation schemer and computational modeler for natural language. His 2014 dissertation (Carnegie Mellon University) introduced a coarse-grained representation for lexical semantics that facilitates rapid annotation and is practical for broad-coverage statistical NLP. He has also worked on semantic parsing for the FrameNet representation, the design of the Abstract Meaning Representation formalism, and other forms of syntactic/semantic annotation and processing for social media text. He is presently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Edinburgh, where he continues to play with data and algorithms for linguistic meaning.

Submissions



Submissions should describe original, unpublished work. Authors are invited to submit two kinds of papers:



    Full papers – Reporting substantial and completed work, especially those that may contribute in a significant way to the advancement of the area. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation results should be included. Full papers can have up to 8 content pages + 2 pages for references.

    Short papers – Reporting small, focused contributions such as ongoing work, position papers, potential ideas to be discussed, negative results, or an interesting application nugget. Short papers can have up to 4 content pages + 1 page for references.



Each submission will be evaluated by at least three reviewers. As reviewing will be double-blind, submitted papers must be anonymized, that is, they should not contain the authors’ names and affiliations. Authors must avoid self-references that reveal identity, like, “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …”. Instead, they should prefer citations such as “Smith (1991) previously showed …”. Separate author identification information will be required as part of the submission process.



Submissions should be written in English. At submission time, only PDF format is accepted. For the final versions, authors of accepted papers will be given 1 extra content page to take the reviews into account. Authors of accepted papers will be requested to send the source files for the production of the proceedings.



Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.

MIREL workshop

MIning and REasoning with Legal texts

in conjunction with LuxLogAI

September 17th - Luxembourg

https://sites.google.com/view/mirelworkshop2018/



Deadline: July 2, 2018



The aim of MIREL-2018 workshop is to bridge the gap between the community working on legal ontologies and NLP parsers and the community working on reasoning methods and formal logic, in line with the objectives of the MIREL (MIning and REasoning with Legal texts) project. The workshop aims at fostering the scientific discussion between approaches based on language technologies applied to the legal domain (representing legal knowledge) and those based on legal reasoning (using the legal knowledge to build specialized services and applications).



Background



Legal scholars and practitioners are feeling increasingly overwhelmed with the expanding set of legislation and case law available these days, which is assuming more and more of an international character. For example, European legislation is estimated to be 170,000 pages long, of which over 100,000 pages have been produced in the last ten years. Furthermore, legislation is available in unstructured formats, which makes it difficult for users to cut through the information overload. As the law gets more complex, conflicting, and ever changing, more advanced methodologies are required for analyzing, representing and reasoning on legal knowledge.



The management of large repositories of norms, and the semantic access and reasoning to these norms are key challenges in Legal Informatics, which is experiencing growth in activity, also at the industrial level. Specifically, it is necessary to address both conceptual challenges, such as the role of legal interpretation in mining and reasoning, and computational challenges, such as the handling of big legal data, and the complexity of regulatory compliance.



Legal domain has always been attractive to language and semantic technology because of its importance for the society with respect to globalization and common markets as well as for its challenges for formalization and specific language use. For this reason, a series of workshops centered in legal informatics and related topics have been organized recently; examples are ICAIL, JURIX, and JURISIN. Furthermore, several research projects in the legal domain have been recently funded by the EU and similar institutions, among which ``MIREL: MIning and REasoning with Legal texts''.

http://www.mirelproject.eu/



Objective



The development of NLP techniques and semantic technologies for automatic analysis and indexing of big data freely available on the web has created opportunities for building new approaches to improve the efficiency, comprehensibility, and consistency of legal systems. Semantic analysis aims at relating syntactic elements – which could be phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, and whole documents - to their meanings in a given domain, including meanings specific to legal information. On the one hand, in recent years the EU has delivered huge amounts of resources on EU law in many languages (such as, EuroParl, JRC, etc.). On the other hand, the matured NLP and Semantic Web technology provides a good inventory: for formalizing the law data in the form of domain ontologies; for automating the process of relevant knowledge extraction from legal documents; and for representing it in form of Linked Data in RDF. This will support legal reasoning tasks such as better search possibilities, compliance checking and decision support, as well as a better presentation of the legal information to professional and non-professional stakeholders.



The aim of MIREL-2018 workshop is to bridge the gap between the community working on legal ontologies and NLP parsers and the community working on reasoning methods and formal logic, towards these objectives described above.



Topics



Language technologies for processing of legal texts

Legal reasoning (searching, compliance checking, decision support)

Ontology design patterns for the legal domain

Ontological modeling of legal data

Core and domain ontologies for the legal domain

Legal knowledge on the Web

Legal Linked Open Data

Machine learning and data mining for legal applications

Adaptation of language processing modules to legal domain

Large-scale normative reasoning

Computational methods for legal reasoning

Extraction of legal Named entities - legal citations, etc.

Legal search engines - requirements, implementations, etc.

Semantic annotations for legal texts

Formal analysis of normative concepts and normative systems

Formal analysis of the semantics/pragmatics of deontic and normative expressions in natural language

Expressive vs. lightweight representations of legal knowledge

Legislation and case law corpora in Linked Open Data

Applications in the legal domain



Submission



We invite submissions up to 12 pages plus 3 additional pages for bibliography and appendix, in LNCS format.



Papers will be published at the IfCoLoG Journal of Logics and their Applications.



Authors shall submit their papers electronically via EasyChair before the due date in PDF format.

### AMTA 2020 Workshop on the Impact of Machine Translation (iMpacT 2020) 

**New date: October 6, 2020**

[https://sites.google.com/view/impact-2020/home]



This workshop is part of the **AMTA 2020 Virtual Conference**, October 6-10, 2020.



Machine Translation is here to stay. For many years, MT has seen advances in the quality of output, the number of users, language pair and domain coverage, as well as the number of enterprises investing in MT. MT is now an integral part of most CAT tools and post-editing is a de facto task required from language professionals in many domains. The introduction and wide-scale adoption of NMT has boosted this even more. Languages and domains that were not supported previously are now serious contenders for MT, at least for gisting, if not for more. As MT becomes more and more mainstream, an increasing number of people are interacting with it, for a variety of purposes, even beyond the commercial language industry. The 2020 AMTA conference is therefore an excellent moment in time to take stock of the nature of this interaction, the impact to date and the potential impact into the future. 



We invite contributions from a broad range of stakeholders (including developers, LSPs, publishers, translators) in order to record and discuss this impact. Speakers are expected to address some of the following topics, or related ones:



* MT and expectations on translator productivity, including productivity tracking 

* MT and its potential ecological impact, negative or positive?

* MT and its impact on natural language, especially concerning bias and diversity

* MT and its impact on cognition (e.g. understanding, readability, usability)

* MT and ethics, including topics such as fair payment for editing, tracking, data privacy

* MT literacy for non-conventional users (academics, health professionals, emergency responders, etcâ€¦)

* MT and future translator training

* MT and second language learning

* MT and modes of interaction for post-editing, e.g. interactive vs. traditional 

* MT and user interfaces, in particular the blurring between TM and MT tools



Abstracts should be between 300 and 500 words, excluding any references, and in PDF.



## Submission instructions



Please submit your abstract no later than 11:59 pm PDT (GMT â€“ 12 hours), Monday June 15, 2020. Submit your PDF file to the iMpacT organizers by email:



* Sharon O'Brien: sharon.obrien@dcu.ie

* Michel Simard: michel.simard@cnrc-nrc.gc.ca



## Multiple Submissions



Work presented at iMpacT must represent new work that has not been previously published. It is the responsibility of the author(s) to inform the organizers of any potential problem with respect to this requirement. Authors submitting similar work both to iMpacT and another conference or workshop must inform the iMpacT organizers, specifying to which other conference or workshop they are submitting their work.



## Notification of Acceptance



Authors will be notified of acceptance by July 3, 2020. Abstracts will be evaluated based on their relevance to the workshop theme, potential for a stimulating presentation, potential appeal to the target audience, and overall quality. Accepted abstracts will be presented as 20 minute presentations at the Workshop (with 10 for discussion). Note that at least one author must register for the Workshop.



## Important Dates:



* Submission of extended abstracts: 15 June 2020

* Notifications: 3 July 2020

* Workshop: 6 October 2020"

The 3rd International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Informal Text  (NLPIT 2017)

In conjunction with The International Conference on Web Engineering (ICWE 2017), 

June 5, 2017, Rome, Italy

http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~badiehm/nlpit2017/

##################################################



Overview

###########

The rapid growth of Internet usage in the last two decades adds new challenges to understand the informal user generated content (UGC) on the Internet. Textual UGC refers to textual posts on social media, blogs, emails, chat conversations, instant messages, forums, reviews, or advertisements that are created by end-users of an online system. A large portion of language used on textual UGC is informal. Informal text is the style of writing that disregards language grammars and uses a mixture of abbreviations and context dependent terms. The straightforward application of state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing approaches on informal text typically results in significantly degraded performance due to the following reasons: the lack of sentence structure; the lack of enough context required; the seldom entities involved; the noisy sparse contents of users' contributions; and the untrusted facts contained. It is the aim of this workshop to bring the attention of researchers to the opportunities and challenges involved in informal text processing. In particular, we are interested in discussing informal text modeling, normalization, mining, and understanding in addition to various application areas in which UGC is involved.



Topics

###########

We invite submissions on topics that include, but are not limited to, the following core NLP approaches for informal UGC: language identification, classification, clustering, filtering, summarization, tokenization, segmentation, morphological analysis, POS tagging, parsing, named entity extraction, named entity disambiguation, relation/fact extraction, semantic annotation, sentiment analysis, language normalization, informality modeling and measuring, language generation, handling uncertainties, machine translation, ontology construction, dictionary construction, etc.

Title: Overcoming the Language Barrier with BabelNet and Multilingual Disambiguation of Text



Abstract: Multilinguality is a key feature of today’s Web, and it is this feature that we leverage and exploit in our research work at the Sapienza University of Rome’s Linguistic Computing Laboratory, which I am going to overview and showcase in this talk. I will start by presenting BabelNet (http://babelnet.org), the largest multilingual encyclopedic dictionary and semantic network (now also a knowledge base), which covers 271 languages and 14 million concepts and named entities. BabelNet provides both coverage for all the open-class parts of speech, thanks to the seamless integration of WordNet, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, OmegaWiki, Wikidata and the Open Multilingual WordNet. Next, I will present Babelfy (http://babelfy.org), a unified approach that leverages BabelNet to jointly perform word sense disambiguation and entity linking in arbitrary languages, with performance on both tasks on a par with, or surpassing, those of task-specific state-of-the-art supervised systems. Babelfy also includes a language-agnostic setting in which languages can be mixed in arbitrary ways. Finally, I will describe the most recent developments, including deep learning approaches to latent vector representations of meaning and word sense disambiguation.



Bio: Roberto Navigli is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science of the Sapienza University of Rome. He was awarded the Marco Somalvico 2013 AI*IA Prize for the best young researcher in AI. He is the first Italian recipient of an ERC Starting Grant in computer science, on multilingual word sense disambiguation (2011-2016), and one of the few computer scientists to have received two ERC Grants (a Consolidator Grant starting in 2017). He was a co-PI of a Google Focused Research Award on Natural Language Understanding. In 2015 he received the META prize for groundbreaking work in overcoming language barriers with BabelNet, a project also highlighted in TIME magazine this year. His research lies in the field of Natural Language Processing (including multilingual word sense disambiguation and induction, multilingual entity linking, large-scale knowledge acquisition, ontology learning from scratch, gamification for NLP, open information extraction and relation extraction). Currently he is an Associate Editor of the Artificial Intelligence Journal.

Important Dates



Submission deadline: April 26, 2021

Notification of acceptance: May 28, 2021

Camera-ready papers due: June 7, 2021

Workshop: August 5-6, 2021

All deadlines are 11:59 pm UTC -12h (""anywhere on Earth"").



Submissions



We solicit three categories of papers: regular workshop papers, extended abstracts and cross-submissions. Only regular workshop papers will be included in the proceedings as archival publications, and only regular workshop papers will be eligible for best paper prizes. All three categories of papers may be long (maximum 8 pages plus references) or short (maximum 4 pages plus references). All submissions should be in PDF format and made through the Softconf website set up for this workshop: https://www.softconf.com/acl2021/w15_repl4nlp2021/.



In line with the ACL main conference policy, camera-ready versions of papers will be given one additional page of content, and no limit to additional pages for references.



Regular Workshop Papers



Authors should submit a long paper of up to 8 pages, or a short paper of up to 4 pages, both with unlimited references, following the ACL 2021 formatting requirements (see the ACL 2021 Call For Papers for reference: https://2021.aclweb.org/calls/papers/). The reported research should be substantially original. Accepted papers will be presented as posters. Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information should be included in the papers; self-reference that identifies the authors should be avoided or anonymized. Accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings.



Supplementary Material: Each submission can be accompanied by a single PDF appendix. The paper submissions need to remain fully self-contained, as these supplementary materials are completely optional, and reviewers are not even asked to review or download them. Supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.



Extended Abstracts



Preliminary but interesting ideas or results that have not been published before may be submitted as extended abstracts. Accepted extended abstracts will be presented as posters, and included in the workshop program and handbook, but will not be included in the workshop proceedings (and are not eligible for best paper prizes).



Extended abstract submissions are therefore ideal for preliminary work which would benefit from exposure but is not ready for publication. Authors should submit a long extended abstract of up to 8 pages, or a short extended abstract of up to 4 pages, both with unlimited references. Submissions should follow the ACL 2021 formatting requirements (see the ACL 2021 Call For Papers for reference: https://2021.aclweb.org/calls/papers/). Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information should be included in the papers; self-reference that identifies the authors should be avoided or anonymized.



Cross-Submissions



In addition to previously unpublished work, we also solicit recent papers on relevant topics that have appeared in a non-NLP venue (e.g., workshop or conference papers at NeurIPS or ICML). Accepted cross-submissions will be presented as posters, with an indication of original venue, but will not be included in the workshop program and handbook, or the workshop proceedings (and are not eligible for best paper prizes). Cross-submissions are ideal for related work which would benefit from exposure to the RepL4NLP audience. Submission length is determined by the original venue. Interested authors should submit their papers in PDF format through the RepL4NLP Softconf website (https://www.softconf.com/acl2021/w15_repl4nlp2021/), with a note on the original venue. Papers in this category do not need to follow the ACL format and selection will be solely determined by the organizing committee.



Best Paper Prizes



To be announced.

Objectives and topics

Today, people working in Natural Language Processing domain are often members of interdisciplinary teams, including computer scientists, experts in artificial intelligence, mathematicians, statisticians, logicians, linguists, philosophers, cognitive scientists, cognitive psychologists, psycholinguists, anthropologists and neuroscientists, among others. Natural Language Processing is not just a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence. It is, also, connected to cognitive sciences through the development of cognitive theories.

We can see Natural Language Processing divided into two parts: (1) its theoretical descriptions ; (2) its concrete implementations. The theoretical aspect includes philosophical hypothesis, psychological hypothesis, linguistics methods as semantics, syntax, morphology, etc., or numerical methods as classification, neural networks, Naive Bayes, deep learning, etc. At the present stage of research, there still a gap between theoretical approaches and computer implementations. There are many computer applications without any solid theoretical foundations, and there are many theoretical methods with no computer implementation. Theoretical Methods and computational implementations for the Natural Language Processing must take into account this epistemological chain for to lead to effective, robust and reliable systems.

Papers and contributions are encouraged for any work relating to Natural Language Processing. Topics of interest may include (but are in no way limited to):

 Philosophy of language – new developments,

 Cognitive semantics,

 Logics of language,

 Language modeling,

 Computational linguistics (lexicology; morphology; syntax; semantics),

 Information extraction,

 Domain ontologies, linguistic ontologies,

 Knowledge processing,

 Translation,

 Text-mining.

 Deep-Learning.

 etc.

LREC 2014 HOT TOPICS



Big Data, Linked Open Data, LRs and HLT



The ever-increasing quantities of large and complex digital datasets, structured or unstructured, multilingual, multimodal or multimedia, pose new challenges but at the same time open up new opportunities for HLT and related fields. Ubiquitous data and information capturing devices, social media and networks, the web at large with its big data / knowledge bases and other information capturing / aggregating / publishing platforms are providing useful information and/or knowledge for a wide range of LT applications.  

LREC 2014 puts a strong emphasis on the synergies of the big Linked Open Data and LRs/LT communities and their complementarity in cracking LT problems and developing useful applications and services.



LRs in the Collaborative Age



The amount of collaboratively generated and used language data is constantly increasing and it is therefore time to open a wide discussion on such LRs at LREC. There is a need to discuss the types of LRs that can be collaboratively generated and used.

Are lexicons, dictionaries, corpora, ontologies (of language data), grammars, tagsets, data categories, all possible fields in which a collaborative approach can be applied? Can collaboratively generated LRs be standardised/harmonised? And how can quality control be applied to collaboratively generated LRs? How can a collaborative approach ensure that less-resourced languages receive the same digital dignity as mainstream languages?

There is also a need to discuss legal aspects related to collaboratively generated LRs. And last but not least: are there different types of collaborative approaches, or is the Wikimedia style the best approach to collaborative generation and use of LRs?



LREC 2014 SPECIAL HIGHLIGHT



Share your LRs!



In addition to describing your LRs in the LRE Map – now a normal step in the submission procedure of many conferences – LREC 2014 recognises that the time is ripe to launch another important initiative, the LREC Repository of shared LRs!

When submitting a paper, you will be offered the possibility to share your LRs (data, tools, web-services, etc.), uploading them in a special LREC META-SHARE repository set up by ELRA.

Your LRs will be made available to all LREC participants before the conference, to be re-used, compared, analysed, …

This effort of sharing LRs, linked to the LRE Map for their description, may become a new ""regular"" feature for conferences in our field, thus contributing to creating a common repository where everyone can deposit and share data.



PROGRAMME

The Scientific Programme will include invited talks, oral presentations, poster and demo presentations, and panels, in addition to a keynote address by the winner of the Antonio Zampolli Prize.



SUBMISSIONS AND DATES

Submission of proposals for oral and poster (or poster+demo) papers: 15 October 2013

Abstracts should consist of about 1500-2000 words, will be submitted through START and will be peer-reviewed.



Submission of proposals for panels, workshops and tutorials: 15 October 2013

Proposals should be submitted via an online form on the LREC website and will be reviewed by the Programme Committee.



PROCEEDINGS

The Proceedings will include both oral and poster papers, in the same format.



There is no difference in quality between oral and poster presentations. Only the appropriateness of the type of communication (more or less interactive) to the content of the paper will be considered.



In addition a Book of Abstracts will be printed.

        SCOPE

---------------------------------------------------------------



The Workshop 'Future and Emerging Trends in Language Technology' has been conceived as a meeting point where experts and professionals in the fields of language technologies and other converging areas will discuss the state of the art, as well as the emerging trends in this sector. The main objective of this workshop is to serve as a bridge between academia and industry, as well as representatives of agencies that coordinate research and innovation policies. The workshop thus guarantees a multidisciplinary identical spirit in which experts will be able to present and analyze the trends that will shape the immediate future in this sector.



Following this approach, the organization of the workshop welcomes the reception of papers under the following categories:



NEW APPLICATIONS OF KEY CONSOLIDATED APPROACHES: Authors can submit their paper on new strategies, models and consolidated techniques at the academic or industrial level that are being used right now to tackle any issue in the field of Language Technology. Papers under this category must provide a brief explanation of the foundations of the approaches proposed and the areas and applications for which those techniques are useful in the present.



EMERGING RESEARCH: Authors can submit their paper under this category when they have preliminary results obtained from ongoing research projects. Papers must describe the motivation of the approach, as well as the scientific, methodological and/or technological approach chosen. Papers must also analyze the advantages and benefits derived from such approaches for a broad application in the field of Language Technology.



CHALLENGE PAPERS: Authors can submit a paper on different fields and convergent areas related to Language Technology describing the occurrence of new and constant challenges for both the academic and the industrial areas. These papers must indicate which areas and specific problems are currently posing a concrete technological and/or methodological challenge. Papers under this category must include the reasons why present-day techniques should be considered insufficient to tackle the issues at hand by the presentation of preliminary research/development results as a justification. Additionally, articles in this section should propose research strategies that can be considered promising to provide sound solutions to the problems defined, with a sound and clear scientific and technical argumentation.

ICAART 2015 Special Session on Partiality, Underspecification, and Natural Language Processing (PUaNLP 2015)



Lisbon (Portugal)

10-12 January, 2015



http://www.icaart.org/PUaNLP.aspx





SCOPE



Computational and technological developments that incorporate natural language are proliferating. Adequate coverage encounters difficult problems related to partiality, underspecification, and context-dependency, which are signature features of information in nature and natural languages. Furthermore, agents (humans or computational systems) are information conveyors, interpreters, or participate as components of informational content. Generally, language expression depends on agents' knowledge, reasoning, perspectives, and interactions. The session covers theoretical work, approaches, and techniques for computational models of information and its presentation by language. The goal is to promote intelligent natural language processing and related models of thought, mental states, reasoning, and other cognitive processes. Computational neuroscience of information and language is of special interest, with existing or potential applications to Artificial Intelligence.



TOPICS



The session invites contributions relevant to the following topics, without limitations to them: 



* Type theories for applications to language and information processing

* Computational grammar of natural language 

* Computational semantics of natural languages 

* Computational syntax-semantics interface 

* Parsing 

* Multilingual processing 

* Large-scale grammars of natural languages

* Models of computation and algorithms for natural language processing 

* Integration of interdisciplinary methods, e.g., formal, symbolic, model theoretic, and other computational methods 

* Computational models of partiality, underspecification, and context-dependency 

* Models of situations, contexts, and agents, for applications to language processing 

* Bio-information and natural language 

* Language processing based on biological fundamentals of information and languages 

* Computational neuroscience of language

Traditionally, the study of information extraction, knowledge processing and language processing is performed by computer scientists, specializing in the application of computers to the processing of a natural language and large structured or semi-structured data-bases. 

Today, people working in information extraction, knowledge processing, and particularly in language processing often work as members of interdisciplinary teams, including linguists (specifically trained in linguistics), language experts (persons with some level of ability in the languages relevant to a given project), statisticians, and computer scientists. In general, computational linguistics draws upon the involvement of linguists, computer scientists, experts in artificial intelligence, mathematicians, logicians, cognitive scientists, cognitive psychologists, psycholinguists, anthropologists and neuroscientists, among others.

Information extraction as part of knowledge processing and language processing, as well, must become more connected to the cognitive sciences through the development of cognitive semantic theories. Information extraction as part of knowledge processing is connected to artificial intelligence through the development of methods and algorithms for all aspects of language analysis and their computer implementation. We can see language analysis divided into two parts: theoretical analysis and application. The theoretical aspect includes standard areas studied in linguistics methods as semantics, syntax, and morphology or numerical methods as those used in information retrieval or text-mining. Semantic theories guide the development of lexical theories, syntactic theories and morphology. Semantic theories can be based on some specific features of computation, but at the present stage of research, there is a gap between linguistic analysis and computer applications in two senses: there are many computer applications without linguistic theoretical support and, conversely, there are a number of theoretical methods with no computer implementation. Semantic as part of computational linguistic and language processing is very related to the logic and to logics. If we accept the hypothesis that there is a logic of language and logics of natural languages, the upstream of each algorithm or method representing the basis of a AI system of language analysis is a logic and a semantic. The downstream of semantic analysis can be found in translation, automatic text generation and even automatic annotation of texts or information retrieval. Generally, the knowledge processing and particularly, the information extraction must take into account this epistemological chain for to lead to effective, robust and reliable systems. 

What is the GOAL of the track?

This track is intended to present works ranking from logical, mathematical, and statistical models in syntax and semantics (logic of objects, topological theories of time and space, lexical associations, etc.) as foundations of the design and analysis to knowledge processing and natural language processing systems and especially to information extraction.

The aim of this conference is to bring together researchers, practitioners, technology market movers, and thought leaders, with a view to advance the state of the art, and the state of the practice in applied research, which is a catalyst in leveraging of Computer Science by enterprises and consumer businesses. In context of  complexity of today’s  information needs, computing needs and security needs, this conference intends to explore the practical implications and desiderata for dealing with complexity of next generation information, computing and security needs for enterprises and consumers alike.



 In context of information, complexity arises from proliferation and diversification of information sources, information formats, information access media, penetration of mobility and trends like BYOD, coupled with large amounts of unstructured data, and need for real time analytics on both classical structured content and unstructured content,  and finally enhanced role of social computing as a source of information and analytics. From a business perspectives these trends of mobility, social, and analytics are changing the way both information is produced as well as consumed. 



In context of computing, the focus has shifted from classical high performance models to scale out models and elastic models like cloud computing, leveraging commodity hardware. Accordingly even software innovations like map reduce which offer a common man approach to building scalable software applications and algorithms thereof. Hence today we are witness a new era of scalable computing, wherein cloud based delivery has become the default mode of delivering solutions. Even from a perspective of high performance systems based on Map Reduce like Hadoop, etc have become mainstream as opposed to classical scale up models. 



From a security perspective, the complexity of security has increased via the increasing penetration of mobiles into workforce, trends like BYOD, coupled with enhanced need for providing services via web for cloud based services, and lastly the need for leveraging public social platforms  for useful information alongside enterprise information.  The resultant heightened attack surface, and newer threat models are a cause of concern and need to be investigated especially in context of providing enterprises confidence in carrying out their business transactions.



The conference shall  provide a forum to  discuss diverse contemporary research and practitioner perspectives covering this theme.

One of the technical challenges that remains an open research area and is coming to the forefront of this field is that of adapting cognitive services across languages, to serve a worldwide community of multilingual and multicultural users. This workshop will address research problems in cognitive service design and development that center around multilingual translation, speech recognition, and - to a degree - text understanding.  These problems include:



● Code mixing: mixed languages in speech and text (conversation, queries, commands)

● Language recognition: identifying languages in small units of mixed natural language

● Accents: identifying and adapting to regional accents and second-language speakers

● Dialogue agents: responses; handling language switching in conversational contexts

● Standardization/transcription: translating mixed texts and transcripts to one language



Nearly 20% of people in the United States, and 56% in Europe, consider themselves to be multilingual.  Self-described bilingual speakers number 43% worldwide and trilingual speakers 13%; only 40% of people across the world are monolingual as of 2018.   In recent years, there has been extensive research on cognitive services, language detection and monolingual translation; however, as globalization adds increasing numbers of multilingual users, the topic of multilingual cognitive services is becoming more prominent, with its own technical challenges, methodologies, and user needs.  This workshop aims at gathering data science and machine learning researchers from many related areas to discuss how to meet these challenges and needs with new data mining approaches.



For example, there are many different brands of home assistants in different countries. However, when they are used by multilingual speakers, failures of natural language recognition by cognitive services can greatly diminish their accessibility and usability, to the point that they become less practical in their primary purpose (speech-based functions) than mobile devices and applications. When multilingual speakers ask for music by their favorite creative artists or search for information on notable people, places, and things, they are often unable to use native personal and place names, or local terms, because these embedded named entities may be treated as foreign phrases by a regionalized cognitive service. The crucial issue is that most cognitive services are regionalized to be intrinsically monolingual, an assumption that is part of the inherent problem for the large and growing body of multilingual users.



Therefore, we seek to bring together researchers from different fields of data mining, including transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary data scientists, to discuss their innovations, views, and visions regarding cutting-edge cognitive services technology.



Active research areas that are related to cognitive services include:



● Data mining and computational linguistics in multilingual domains

● Multimodal data science, especially video (dialogues, speechreading)

● Machine learning using multilingual natural language data, including text/transcripts

● Multilingual speech recognition/prediction with deep learning/artificial neural nets

● Human-centered computing, including cognitive models and user modeling

● Home assistants and other dialogue agents

● Machine translation

● Human-robot interaction (HRI) and human-computer interaction (HCI)

● Usability of interactive services: how to respond to multilingual queries and dialogue

● User adaptation and personalization

● Understanding emotions in user context: home/work, friends/strangers, online/in person"

For the past fifteen years, the workshops in the TextGraphs series have published and promoted the synergy between the field of Graph Theory (GT) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The mix between the two started small, with graph theoretical frameworks providing efficient and elegant solutions for NLP applications. Graph-based solutions initially focused on single-document part-of-speech tagging, word sense disambiguation, and semantic role labeling, and became progressively larger to include ontology learning and information extraction from large text collections. Nowadays, graph-based solutions also target on Web-scale applications such as information propagation in social networks, rumor proliferation, e-reputation, multiple entity detection, language dynamics learning, and future events prediction, to name a few. 



The fifteenth edition of the TextGraphs workshop aims to extend the focus on graph-based representations for (1) large-scale knowledge bases and reasoning about them and (2) graph-based and graph-supported machine learning and deep learning methods.

# Shared Task



We are organizing a shared task before the workshop!



Many-hop multi-hop inference is challenging because there are often multiple ways of assembling a good explanation for a given question. This 2021 instantiation of the shared task focuses on the theme of determining relevance versus completeness in large multi-hop explanations. To this end, this year we include a very large dataset of approximately 250,000 expert-annotated relevancy ratings for facts ranked highly by baseline language models from previous years (e.g. BERT, RoBERTa).



Submissions using a variety of methods (graph-based or otherwise) are encouraged. Submissions that evaluate how well existing models designed on 2-hop multihop question answering datasets (e.g. HotPotQA, QASC, etc) perform at many-fact multi-hop explanation regeneration are welcome.

Overview

This session aims to discuss the fundamental and applied problems in social media, artificial intelligence, natural language and multimedia processing, and crowdsourcing technologies. The main goal of this event is to unite researchers who study social interactions on the Internet, as well as researchers from the related fields without whose contribution the study of social networks would become difficult or impossible. Our task is to discuss how to analyze the digital traces left behind by a person's activities and what conclusions can be made based on this analysis.



We welcome researchers from both humanities and technical sciences who study social networks and social interactions on the Internet, the relationship between the virtual and real-world identities. The task is to create an interdisciplinary platform for the integration of artificial intelligence and data mining approaches with sociological, psychological and linguistic studies. The event focuses on two main points: (1) integration of data mining and social mining approaches with the approaches from humanities and other technical disciplines, (2) integration of the natural language/multimedia processing with the personalized services on the Web.



The session continues a series of events including the 1st Intensive Social Media Week (2015), the AINL-ISMW FRUCT conference (2015) and the ISMW FRUCT school and conference (2016), ISMW seminars 2017-2019.

All session papers will be published Open Access in FRUCT proceeding at no additional cost (available for free under a CC BY-ND license download from FRUCT proceedings catalog). The session posters and demos can be presented on the FRUCT26 Demo Session (April 23, 2020).



********************************* 

Call for papers and presentations 

*********************************



You can select one of the following 3 types of submissions:

- Full papers (min 6 full pages and up to 12 pages), deadline February 28, 2020;

- Short papers (min 2 pages, max 6 pages), deadline February 28, 2020;

- Poster or demo summary (min 200 words, max 4 pages), by April 13, 2020.



Traditionally FRUCT doesn't provide deadline extension, as instead, we have early-bird submissions mechanism. But if authors need a couple of extra days to finalize a paper, please send in advance email to info(at)fruct.org and we will try to arrange it so that you can finalize your work.



The review process is organized as follows:

- Full papers get at least 3 reviews by the Technical Committee

- Short papers and Poster/demo summaries get at least 2 reviews by the Technical Committee

- The review process is organized as the single-blind review

- The acceptance rate is below 45% (5 years)

- Authors of selected best papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers to be published in partner journals.



Please note that some papers submitted as Full Papers can be recommended for publication in ACM section (AKA WiP) of the proceedings. ACM section includes papers that have passed the quality check but didn't get in top 40% of the papers based on the average score. This will be a normal publication, but with less guaranteed indexing (read more: https://www.fruct.org/Full_vs_WiP). To increase your chance to get your paper accepted as Full Paper, we recommend to submit it by the Early bird submission deadline, as this way you always will have a second chance to improve the paper and get another round of review. The conference language is English.



*The Early bird submission deadline: February 7, 2020.



Please note that one person can be a coauthor of at maximum 3 submissions of all types: Submit

PAPER SUBMISSION INFORMATION



Long Papers



Long paper submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Review forms will be made available prior to the deadlines.

Long papers may consist of up to 8 pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references; final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.



Long papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and which as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings between long papers presented orally and as posters.



Short Papers



Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages. Some kinds of short papers are:



- A small, focused contribution

- A negative result

- An opinion piece

- An interesting application nugget



Short papers may consist of up to 4 pages of content, plus unlimited references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given 5 content pages in the proceedings. Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address reviewers’ comments in their final versions.



Short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers presented orally and as posters.





Authorship



The author list for submissions should include all (and only) individuals who made substantial contributions to the work presented. Each author listed on a submission to EMNLP 2020 will be notified of submissions, revisions and the final decision. No changes to the order or composition of authorship may be made to submissions to EMNLP 2020 after the paper submission deadline.





Citation and Comparison



You are expected to cite all refereed publications relevant to your submission, but you may be excused for not knowing about all unpublished work (especially work that has been recently posted and/or is not widely cited).



In cases where a preprint has been superseded by a refereed publication, the refereed publication should be cited instead of the preprint version.



Papers (whether refereed or not) appearing less than 3 months before the submission deadline are considered contemporaneous to your submission, and you are therefore not obliged to make detailed comparisons that require additional experimentation and/or in-depth analysis.



For more information, see the ACL Policies for Submission, Review, and Citation [https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/new-policies-submission-review-and-citation]





Multiple Submission Policy



EMNLP 2020 will not consider any paper that is under review in a journal or another conference at the time of submission, and submitted papers must not be submitted elsewhere during the EMNLP 2020 review period. This policy covers all refereed and archival conferences and workshops (e.g., COLING, NeurIPS, ACL workshops). For example, a paper under review at an ACL workshop cannot be dual-submitted to EMNLP 2020. In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Authors submitting more than one paper to EMNLP 2020 must ensure that their submissions do not overlap significantly ()25%) with each other in content or results.





Paper Submission and Templates



Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system. Paper template files will be provided soon on the conference website. 





Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data



Each EMNLP 2020 submission can be accompanied by one PDF appendix for the paper, one PDF for prior reviews and author response, one .tgz or .zip archive containing software, and one.tgz or .zip archive containing data. EMNLP 2020 encourages the submission of these supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results, and to enable authors to provide additional information that does not fit in the paper. For example, anonymised related work (see above), preprocessing decisions, model parameters, feature templates, lengthy proofs or derivations, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of the work described in the paper can be put into the appendix. However, the paper submissions need to remain fully self-contained, as these supplementary materials are completely optional, and reviewers are not even asked to review or download them. If the pseudo-code or derivations or model specifications are an important part of the contribution, or if they are important for the reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work, they should be a part of the main paper, and not appear in the appendix. Supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.





ANOMINITY PERIOD



The following rules and guidelines are meant to protect the integrity of double-blind review and ensure that submissions are reviewed fairly. The rules make reference to the anonymity period, which runs from 1 month before the submission deadline (starting May 01 2020) up to the date when your paper is accepted or rejected (September 14 2020). Papers that are withdrawn during this period will no longer be subject to these rules.



- You may not make a non-anonymized version of your paper available online to the general community (for example, via a preprint server) during the anonymity period. Versions of the paper include papers having essentially the same scientific content but possibly differing in minor details (including title and structure) and/or in length.



- If you have posted a non-anonymized version of your paper online before the start of the anonymity period, you may submit an anonymized version to the conference. The submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version, and you must inform the programme chairs that a non-anonymized version exists.



- You may not update the non-anonymized version during the anonymity period, and we ask you not to advertise it on social media or take other actions that would further compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period.



- You may make an anonymized version of your paper available (for example, on OpenReview), even during the anonymity period.



- Note that, while you are not prohibited from making a non-anonymous version available online before the start of the anonymity period, this does make double-blind reviewing more difficult to maintain, and we therefore encourage you to wait until the end of the anonymity period. Alternatively, you may consider submitting your work to the Computational Linguistics journal, which does not require anonymization and has a track for “short” (i.e., conference-length) papers.





INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOUBLE-BLIND REVIEW



As reviewing will be double blind, papers must not include authors’ names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references or links (such as github) that reveal the author’s identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.



Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents that are not available to the reviewers. For example, do not omit or redact important citation information to preserve anonymity. Instead, use third person or named reference to this work, as described above (“Smith showed” rather than “we showed”). If important citations are not available to reviewers (e.g., awaiting publication), these paper/s should be anonymised and included in the appendix. They can then be referenced from the submission without compromising anonymity.



Papers may be accompanied by a resource (software and/or data) described in the paper, but these resources should also be anonymized.





NEW: STICKY REVIEWS (optional)



Authors resubmitting a paper that has been rejected from another venue are invited to submit alongside their paper the previous version of the paper, the reviews and an author response. This is strictly optional. It is designed to mimic the revise-and-resubmit procedure underlying journals like TACL, and this trial for EMNLP will help to inform potential changes to the review process under consideration for future EMNLP and ACL conferences. We expect that the fact that a paper was rejected from another venue will not necessarily affect the paper’s decision in a negative way, but is likely to be beneficial to authors who believe they have addressed the problems identified, and can argue strongly for how the paper has been improved. The prior reviews will not be seen by reviewers, but be used as part of the EMNLP decision process, primarily by area chairs and program chairs in review quality control, resolving disagreements between reviewers, and in deciding borderline papers. 





NEW: REPRODUCIBILITY CRITERIA



To foster reproducibility, authors will be asked to answer all questions from the following Reproducibility Checklist during the submission process. Authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist, but rather check off the criteria relevant to their submission. The answers will be made available to the reviewers to help them evaluate the submission. Reviewers will be expressly asked to assess the reproducibility of the work as part of their reviews. 



The following list is a preliminary checklist we will use.



For all reported experimental results:

[ ] A clear description of the mathematical setting, algorithm, and/or model. 

[ ] A link to a downloadable source code, with specification of all dependencies, including external libraries 

[ ] Description of computing infrastructure used

[ ] Average runtime for each approach

[ ] Number of parameters in each model

[ ] Corresponding validation performance for each reported test result

[ ] Explanation of evaluation metrics used, with links to code



For all experiments with hyperparameter search:

[ ] Bounds for each hyperparameter

[ ] Hyperparameter configurations for best-performing models

[ ] Number of hyperparameter search trials

[ ] The method of choosing hyperparameter values (e.g., uniform sampling, manual tuning, etc.) and the criterion used to select among them (e.g., accuracy)

[ ] Expected validation performance, as introduced in Section 3.1 in Paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03004.pdf), or another measure of the mean and variance as a function of the number of hyperparameter trials.



For all datasets used:

[ ] Relevant statistics such as number of examples

[ ] Details of train/validation/test splits

[ ] Explanation of any data that were excluded, and all pre-processing steps

[ ] A link to a downloadable version of the data

[ ] For new data collected, a complete description of the data collection process, such as instructions to annotators and methods for quality control.



Thanks to Jesse Dodge for helping with the above checklist. It is based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03004.pdf and https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ReproducibilityChecklist.pdf





PRESENTATION REQUIREMENT



All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at EMNLP 2020 must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline if they wish to withdraw the paper.



Previous presentations of the work (e.g. preprints on arXiv.org) should be indicated in a footnote in the final version of papers appearing in the EMNLP 2020 proceedings. Please note that this footnote should not be in the submission version of the paper.



At least one author of each accepted paper must register for EMNLP 2020 by the early registration deadline.

=== Scope and Aim of the Workshop ===

The open access movement in scientific publishing and search engines like Google Scholar have made scientific articles more broadly accessible. During the last decade, the availability of scientific papers in full text has become more and more widespread thanks to the growing number of publications on online platforms such as ArXiv and CiteSeer. The efforts to provide articles in machine-readable formats and the rise of Open Access publishing have resulted in a number of standardized formats for scientific papers (such as NLM-JATS, TEI, DocBook), full-text datasets for research experiments (PubMed, JSTOR, etc.) and corpora (iSearch, etc.). At the same time, research in the field of Natural Language Processing have provided a number of open source tools for versatile text processing (e.g. NLTK, Mallet, OpenNLP, CoreNLP, Gate, CiteSpace). 



Scientific papers are highly structured texts and display specific properties related to their references but also argumentative and rhetorical structure. Recent research in this field has concentrated on the construction of ontologies for citations and scientific articles (e.g. CiTO, LinkedScience1) and studies of the distribution of references . However, up to now full-text mining efforts are rarely used to provide data for bibliometric analyses. While bibliometrics traditionally relies on the analysis of metadata of scientific papers (see e.g. a recent special issue on Combining Bibliometrics and Information Retrieval, Mayr & Scharnhorst, 2015), we will explore the ways full-text processing of scientific papers and linguistic analyses can play. With this workshop we like to discuss novel approaches and provide insights into scientific writing that can bring new perspectives to understand both the nature of citations and the nature of scientific articles. The possibility to enrich metadata by the full-text processing of papers offers new fields of application to bibliometrics studies.

Working with full text allows us to go beyond metadata used in bibliometrics. Full text offers a new field of investigation, where the major problems arise around the organization and structure of text, the extraction of information and its representation on the level of metadata. Furthermore, the study of contexts around in-text citations offers new perspectives related to the semantic dimension of citations. The analyses of citation contexts and the semantic categorization of publications will allow us to rethink co-citation networks, bibliographic coupling and other bibliometric techniques. 



The workshop aims to bring together researchers in bibliometrics and computational linguistics in order to study the ways bibliometrics can benefit from large-scale text analytics and sense mining of scientific papers, thus exploring the interdisciplinarity of Bibliometrics and Natural Language Processing. How can we enhance author network analysis and bibliometrics using data obtained by text analytics? What insights can NLP provide on the structure of scientific writing, on citation networks, and on in-text citation analysis?





=== Workshop Topics ===

Topics include (but are not limited to) the following:

- Linguistic modeling and discourse analysis for scientific texts

- User interfaces, text representations and visualizations

- Structure of scientific articles (discourse / argumentative / rhetorical / social)

- Scientific corpora and paper standards

RATIONALE

The opportunity to capture the opinions of the general public has raised growing interest both within the scientific community, leading to many exciting open challenges, as well as in the business world, due to the remarkable benefits to be had from marketing and financial prediction. Mining opinions and sentiments from natural language, however, is an extremely difficult task as it involves a deep understanding of most of the explicit and implicit, regular and irregular, syntactical and semantic rules proper of a language. Existing approaches to sentiment analysis mainly rely on parts of text in which opinions are explicitly expressed such as polarity terms, affect words, and their co-occurrence frequencies. However, opinions and sentiments are often conveyed implicitly through latent semantics, which make purely syntactical approaches ineffective.



Concept-level approaches, instead, use Web ontologies or semantic networks to accomplish semantic text analysis. This helps the system grasp the conceptual and affective information associated with natural language opinions. By relying on large semantic knowledge bases, such approaches step away from blindly using keywords and word co-occurrence counts, and instead rely on the implicit meaning/features associated with natural language concepts. Superior to purely syntactical techniques, concept-based approaches can detect subtly expressed sentiments. Concept-based approaches, in fact, can analyze multi-word expressions that do not explicitly convey emotion, but are related to concepts that do.



Sentic computing, in particular, is a multi-disciplinary approach to sentiment analysis at the crossroads between affective computing and common sense computing, which exploits both computer and social sciences to better recognize, interpret, and process opinions and sentiments over the Web. In sentic computing, whose term derives from the Latin sentire (root of words such as sentiment and sentience) and sensus (intended both as capability of feeling and as common sense), the analysis of natural language is based on affective ontologies and common sense reasoning tools, which enable the analysis of text not only at document-, page- or paragraph-level, but also at sentence-, clause-, and concept-level.



TOPICS

This special issue focuses on the introduction, presentation, and discussion of new approaches that further develop and apply sentic computing models, techniques, and tools, for the design of emotion-sensitive applications in fields such as social media marketing, human-computer interaction, and e-health. The main motivation for the special issue, in particular, is to further explore how the passage from (unstructured) natural language to (structured) machine-processable data can be implemented, in potentially any domain, through the application of sentic computing or an ensemble of sentic computing and other approaches. Articles are thus invited in areas such as weakly supervised learning, active learning, transfer learning, novel neural and cognitive models, data mining, pattern recognition, knowledge-based systems, information retrieval, natural language processing, and big data computing. Topics include, but are not limited to:

• Sentic computing for social media marketing

• Sentic computing for big social data analysis

• Sentic computing for social media visualization and retrieval

• Sentic computing for biologically inspired opinion mining

• Sentic computing for cognitive and affective modeling

• Sentic computing for metaphor detection and understanding

• Sentic computing for patient opinion mining

• Sentic computing for opinion spam detection

• Sentic computing for online advertising

• Sentic computing for social network modeling and analysis

• Sentic computing for multi-modal sentiment analysis

• Sentic computing for human-agent, -computer, and -robot interaction

• Sentic computing for image analysis and understanding

• Sentic computing for user profiling and personalization

• Sentic computing for aided affective knowledge acquisition

• Sentic computing for multi-lingual sentiment analysis

• Sentic computing for time-evolving sentiment tracking

• Sentic computing for cross-domain evaluation

The special issue also welcomes papers on specific application domains of sentic computing, e.g., influence networks, customer experience management, intelligent user interfaces, multimedia management, computer-mediated human-human communication, enterprise feedback management, surveillance, and art. To be considered, authors will need to clearly establish relevance of their paper to the scope of the special issue and the journal. Authors will be required to follow the Author's Guide for manuscript submission to Cognitive Computation.



TIMEFRAME

February 15th, 2014: Paper submission deadline

March 15th, 2014: Notification of acceptance

April 15th, 2014: Final manuscript due

June, 2014: Publication



SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

The Cognitive Computation special issue on Sentic Computing will consist of papers on novel methods and techniques that further develop and apply big data analysis tools and techniques in the context of opinion mining and sentiment analysis. Some papers may survey various aspects of the topic. The balance between these will be adjusted to maximize the issue's impact. Authors are required to follow Cognitive Computation's Instructions for Authors and to submit their papers through Editorial Manager, after specifing the name of the special issue. All articles are expected to successfully negotiate the standard review procedures for Cognitive Computation.

He writes a semi-regular column titled ‘Industry Watch’ for the Journal of Natural Language Engineering.



#Tutorials



We are very happy to announce the following tutorial:



Tutorial Presentation: Ben Hachey

Tutorial Development: Ben Hachey, Will Radford, Bo Han



Working Title: Active Learning… and Beyond! 🚀



Working Abstract:

This half-day session will take participants through situations they might face applying Natural Language Processing to real-world problems. We’ll choose a canonical task (text classification) and focus on the main issue that faces practitioners in green fields projects - where does the data come from? Our aim is to equip participants with the theoretical background and practical skills to quickly build high-quality text classification models.



#Format

 

We invite submissions of two different formats: (1) Original Research Papers and (2) Abstract-based Presentations

 

## Original Research Papers

 

We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all aspects of natural language processing.

 

Long papers should be 6-8 pages. Accepted long papers will have a 15 minute slot for oral presentation plus 5 minutes for questions and discussion.

Short papers should be 3-4 pages. Accepted short papers will have a poster presentation plus a short approximately 5 minute talk to advertise the poster.

Both formats may include up to 2 pages of references in addition to these page count requirements.

 

Note that the review process is double-blind, and accordingly submitted papers should not include the identity of author(s) and the text should be suitably anonymised, e.g., using third person wording for self-citations, not providing URLs to your personal website, etc.

 

Original research papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which will be published online in the ACL anthology and the ALTA website. Long papers will be distinguished from short papers in the proceedings.

 

## Abstract-based Presentations

 

To encourage broader participation and facilitate local socialisation of international results, we continue the presentations format introduced last year. We invite submissions of 1-2 page presentation abstracts. These will not be published in the proceedings, but simply reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to ensure that they are on topic, coherent and likely to be of interest to the ALTA community. Abstracts on work in progress and work published or submitted elsewhere are encouraged. ALTA invites submissions of all manner interesting research, not limited to, but including:

 

- established academics giving an overview of an exciting paper or paper/s published in international venues;

- completing research students giving an overview of their thesis work;

- early candidature research students presenting their work-in-progress and ideas, which may not have been published; and

- industry presenting research and development over linguistic data in the context of their business.

 

Presentation abstracts should not be anonymised, any publications relating to the work should be cited in the submission, and the person who will give the presentation should be clearly stated. 

 

# Topics



ALTA invites the submission of papers and presentations on all aspects of natural language processing, including, but not limited to:

 

- phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse;

- speech understanding and generation;

- interpreting spoken and written language;

- natural language generation;

- linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language;

- NLP-based information extraction and retrieval;

- corpus-based and statistical language modelling;

- machine translation and translation aids;

- question answering and information extraction;

- natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;

- natural language and multimodal systems;

- message and narrative understanding systems;

- evaluations of language systems;

- embodied conversational agents;

- computational lexicography;

- summarisation;

- language resources;

- topic modelling and unsupervised language analysis;

- social media analysis and processing; 

- domain-specific adaptation of natural language processing algorithms; and

- applied natural language processing and/or applications in industry.

 

We particularly encourage submissions that broaden the scope of our community through the consideration of practical applications of language technology and through multi-disciplinary research. We also specifically encourage submissions from industry.

 

#Multiple Submission Policy

 

Original research papers that are under review for other publication venues or that you intend to submit elsewhere may be submitted in parallel to ALTA. We request that you declare at submission that your paper is submitted to another venue, and identify the venue. Should your paper be accepted to both ALTA and another venue, we allow you to decide whether the paper should be published in the ALTA proceedings, or if it should be treated as a Presentation (without archival publication). In this case you would still be able to present a research talk at the ALTA workshop. This is to encourage more internationally leading research to be presented at the workshop.



# Student Funding

As in previous years, ALTA will provide student travel support to attend the workshop.  For more information, please see the ALTA Workshop website.

Proceedings:

============

Contributions will be included in the Companion volume of the ACM

WWW2015 conference, which will be published by ACM and included

in the ACM Digital Library.



However, to make that happen at least one author of the accepted

paper has to register. At the time of submission of the final

camera-ready copy, authors will have to indicate the already

registered person for that publication.



Any paper published by the ACM, IEEE, etc. which can be properly

cited constitutes research which must be considered in judging the

novelty of a WWW submission, whether the published paper was in a

conference, journal, or workshop. Therefore, any paper previously

published as part of a WWW workshop must be referenced and suitably

extended with new content to qualify as a new submission to the

Research Track at the WWW conference.



Submission guidelines:

======================

All submitted papers must

    * be written in English;

    * contain author names, affiliations, and email addresses;

    * be formatted according to the ACM SIG Proceedings template

    (http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates)

    with a font size no smaller than 9pt;

    * be in PDF (make sure that the PDF can be viewed on any

    platform), and formatted for US Letter size;

    * occupy no more than six pages, including the abstract,

    references, and appendices.



It is the authors responsibility to ensure that their submissions

adhere strictly to the required format.

Submissions that do not comply with the above guidelines may be

rejected without review.

Indeed, the humanities are rarely subject to privacy principles (privacy by design, GDPR…) that affect most social science works and are not just about digital or binary data. Moreover, in DH the data pre-exist and are most often already known if they are not collected and formalized. In this specific context, we propose in this track to question the practices resulting from the constitution of corpus and uses of data in humanities.



This track is intended to be interdisciplinary to cover various aspects of the humanities that use various models, methods, and analyses for the cross-fertilization of knowledge. With regard to the reuse of research-generated data, its implementation is encouraged with developments in open and reproducible science. For example, we propose to analyze links between political and social injunctions to data sharing, the requirements of funding organizations and the reality of Humanities issues. We also wish to discuss methods of controlling the quality of the data whether they are “captured” (i.e. Drucker’s “capta”) or “produced” as well as the possibility of “linking” them with each other and with authoritative organisms, vocabularies, and description schemes.



So, what will be the new uses of research data to consider in Humanities? When and how to prepare to share the data produced? Finally, what are the pitfalls to avoid?



﻿﻿Main topics



Contributions may address one or more of the following topics



    Visualization of humanities data for the answer to scientific questions (questions of ethics, graphic semiology ...).

    Mathematics and humanities (statistics, clustering ...).

    Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the humanities.

    Emergence of research questions in humanities through digital methods.

    Cartography and the humanities.

    Data identified and linked in humanities (LOD).

    Methodology and modeling in digital humanities: the importance of maieutic (Socratic method).

    Practices of sharing data from digital humanities.

    Multidisciplinary point of view dealing with humanities’ data: Methodological and epistemic negotiations."

In conjunction with the  ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2017), Singapore



****************************************************************************************

In an increasingly digital urban setting, Connected & Concerned Citizens typically give voice to their opinions on various civic topics online over the social media.  Efficient and scalable analysis of these citizen voices on social media to derive actionable insights is an essential need for developing smart cities.  The very nature of the data namely its heterogeneity and dynamism, the lack of large annotated corpora, and the need for multi-dimensional analysis across space, time and semantics, makes urban social media analytics challenging. This workshop is dedicated to the theme of social media analytics for smart cities, with the aim of focusing the interest of CIKM research community on the challenges in mining social media data for urban informatics. We are interested in fostering cross collaboration between researchers on information retrieval, social media analytics, linguistics, social scientists, and civic authorities, to develop scalable and practical solutions to the real life problems of cities as voiced by their citizens in social media. The aim of this workshop is to encourage researchers to develop techniques for urban analytics of social media data, with specific focus on applying these techniques to practical urban informatics applications of smart cities.

------------------------



Research in healthcare informatics, natural language processing and understanding, information extraction, and textual inference has advanced considerably in recent years, resulting in powerful models that are able to facilitate clinical prediction tasks such as readmission prediction, diagnostic code group prediction, length-of-stay prediction, and others. The (first) special session on Healthcare Analytics and Language Processing (HeAL) held at FICTA 2020 is an interdisciplinary forum for researchers and industry experts interested in the domain of automated processing of healthcare documents. In a broader perspective, healthcare documents comprise clinical nursing notes, clinical guidelines, social media health-related posts, electronic medical records, biomedical literature, health forums and blogs, or any other type of health-related documents. The HeAL special session aims at fostering the interactions among medical informatics, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence. With this special session, we aim at welcoming submissions on topics concerning natural language processing of healthcare documents, particularly emphasizing on the multidisciplinary aspects of such documentation and the interplay between medical and nursing sciences, computational linguistics, information systems, and computer science.



Leading Topics of Interest

-----------------------------



We are soliciting works portraying original research (not submitted elsewhere). Papers are not limited to describing completed and substantial work, they could also demonstrate a negative result, focus on the contribution(s), work-in-progress, or chronicle the opportunities and possibilities. The leading topics at HeAL include, but are not limited to, the following processing techniques (and related areas):



+ Classification and document (text) mining problems and applications – e.g., predictive analysis, handling imbalanced datasets, feature modeling, and others.

+ Text representations – e.g., embeddings, handling data sparsity and high-dimensionality, and others.

+ Evaluation – e.g., reference (gold) standard construction, annotation, informative evaluation metrics, and others.

+ Syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic analysis of healthcare documents.

+ Domain Adaptation – e.g., adapting NLP tools (PoS taggers, tokenizers, etc.) in medical domain.

+ Deidentification of health records (and ethics).

+ Aiding the development of medical ontologies.

+ Medical text summarization and simplification – e.g., summarizing medical documents, summarizing patient reports, and others.

+ Clinical decision-making – e.g., development of clinical decision support systems, and others.

+ Approaches involving (supporting) information extraction – e.g., uncertainty detection, named entity recognition, and others.

+ Information fusion for decision-making – e.g., using multimodal data for prediction applications, and others.

+ Adverse event modeling – e.g., hospital-acquired infections, adverse drug events, and others.

+ Population analytics – e.g., analysis of social media posts, epidemiology studies, and others.

The conference is intended for researchers and practitioners interested in data science. Similarly to the previous year, the conference will be particularly focused on innovative applications of data mining and machine learning techniques to image processing, analysis of social networks, text processing and other domains, such as economics or geographic information systems.



The conference is intended for computer scientists and practitioners whose research interests are related to data science. The previous conferences in 2012-2018 attracted a significant number of students, researchers, academics and engineers working on the analysis of images, texts, and social networks. The broad scope of AIST makes it an event where researchers from different domains, such as image and text processing, exploiting various data analysis techniques, can meet and exchange ideas. The conference allows specialists from different fields to meet each other, present their work, and discuss both theoretical and practical aspects of their data analysis problems. Another important aim of the conference is to stimulate scientists and people from the industry to benefit from the knowledge exchange and identify possible grounds for fruitful collaboration.

This task follows up on the successful CL-SciSumm 2018 @ SIGIR 2018 and three previous editions. In this task, a training corpus CL research papers are released. Participants are invited to enter their systems in a task-based evaluation on a blind test set.



The CLSciSumm19 corpus is expected to be of interest to a broad community including those working in computational linguistics and natural language processing, text summarization, discourse structure in scholarly discourse, paraphrase, textual entailment and text simplification. The task constitutes automatic scientific paper summarization in the Computational Linguistics (CL) domain. The output summaries will be of two types: faceted summaries of the traditional self-summary (the abstract) and the community summary (the collection of citation sentences ‘citances’). We also propose to group the citances by the facets of the text that they refer to.



This is the 5th edition of the Shared Task, 3rd at SIGIR, following the 2nd edition at JCDL‘16 and a successful Pilot task at TAC ‘14 at NIST, USA.



=== Important Dates ===

Training Set Release: Already Online

Deadline for Registration and Short System Descriptions - March 30, 2019

=== The CL-SciSumm Corpus ===

The CL-SciSumm corpus is created by randomly sampling documents from the ACL Anthology corpus and selecting their citing papers. Citing paper may include papers from outside the Anthology.



The manually annotated training set of 40 reference papers and citing papers is already available for download and can be used by participants to pilot their systems. Further, this year we have introduced 1000 documents sets that were automatically annotated to be used as training data. This training data was generated following Nomoto,2018.Further, for Task 2 one thousand summaries that were released as part of the SciSummNet (Yasunaga et al., 2019) have been included as human summaries to train on.



The training set of articles is available for download at GitHub (https://github.com/WING-NUS/scisumm-corpus) and can be used by participants to pilot their systems.



The test set (input documents with blind ground truth) of 20 articles is available in https://github.com/WING-NUS/scisumm-corpus/tree/master/data/Test-Set-2018. 



The system outputs from the test set should be submitted to the task organizers, for the collation of the final results to be presented at the workshop.

One of the technical challenges that remains an open research area and is coming to the forefront of this field is that of adapting cognitive services across languages, to serve a worldwide community of multilingual and multicultural users. This workshop will address research problems in cognitive service design and development that center around multilingual translation, speech recognition, and - to a degree - text understanding.  These problems include:



Code mixing: mixed languages in speech and text (conversation, queries, commands)

Language recognition: identifying languages in small units of mixed natural language

Accents: identifying and adapting to regional accents and second-language speakers

Dialogue agents: responses; handling language switching in conversational contexts

Standardization/transcription: translating mixed texts and transcripts to one language



Recent research on cognitive services, language detection and monolingual translation has been extensive; however, as globalization adds increasing numbers of multilingual users, the topic of multilingual cognitive services is becoming more prominent, with its own technical challenges, methodologies, and user needs.  This workshop aims at gathering data science and machine learning researchers from many related areas to discuss how to meet these challenges and needs with new data mining approaches.



For example, there are many different brands of home assistants in different countries. However, when they are used by multilingual speakers, failures of natural language recognition by cognitive services can greatly diminish their accessibility and usability, to the point that they become less practical in their primary purpose (speech-based functions) than mobile devices and applications. When multilingual speakers ask for music by their favorite creative artists or search for information on notable people, places, and things, they are often unable to use native personal and place names, or local terms, because these embedded named entities may be treated as foreign phrases by a regionalized cognitive service. The crucial issue is that most cognitive services are regionalized to be intrinsically monolingual, an assumption that is part of the inherent problem for the large and growing body of multilingual users.



Therefore, we seek to bring together researchers from different fields of data mining, including transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary data scientists, to discuss their innovations, views, and visions regarding cutting-edge cognitive services technology.



Active research areas that are related to cognitive services include:



● Data mining and computational linguistics in multilingual domains

● Multimodal data science, especially video (dialogues, speechreading)

● Machine learning using multilingual natural language data, including text/transcripts

● Multilingual speech recognition/prediction with deep learning/artificial neural nets

● Human-centered computing, including cognitive models and user modeling

● Home assistants and other dialogue agents

● Machine translation

● Human-robot interaction (HRI) and human-computer interaction (HCI)

● Usability of interactive services: how to respond to multilingual queries and dialogue

● User adaptation and personalization

● Understanding emotions in user context: home/work, friends/strangers, online/in person

FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS



The European Language Resource Association (ELRA) is glad to announce the 11th edition of LREC, organised with the support of international organisations – many from Asia: the Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing (AFNLP), Oriental COCOSDA, the Association of Natural Language Processing - Japan, the Chinese Information Processing Society of China, the Linguistic Data Consortium,...



CONFERENCE AIMS

LREC is the major event on Language Resources (LRs) and Evaluation for Human Language Technologies (HLT). LREC aims to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art, explore new R&D directions and emerging trends, exchange information regarding LRs and their applications, evaluation methodologies and tools, communicate on-going and planned activities, identify industrial uses and needs, and address requirements from e-science and e-society, with respect to scientific, technology, policy and organisational issues.



For this edition, LREC goes East in order to support a stronger interaction and synergy with the Asian NLP community and to help promoting Asian Language Resources and Language Technologies.



LREC provides a unique forum for researchers, industrials and funding agencies from a wide spectrum of related disciplines to discuss issues and opportunities, find new synergies and promote initiatives for international cooperation, in support of investigations in language sciences, progress in language technologies (LTs) and development of corresponding products, services and applications, and standards.

* Multilingual issues, language coverage and diversity, less-resourced languages

* Open, linked and shared data and tools, open and collaborative architectures

* Replicability and reproducibility issues

* Organisational, economical, ethical and legal issues



LREC 2018 HOT TOPICS



Asian Language Resources

Special attention will be devoted to highlight the wide variety of initiatives for the creation, use and evaluation of Asian Language Resources and Technologies. Special attention will be paid to Less-Resourced Languages in the Asian area, including (local) Sign Languages.



International Contribution to Olympics 2020

LREC 2018 would like to promote all LTs that would support better interactions and communications between the Olympics 2020 visitors and the local hosts. This involves all speech- and text-based computer interactions, speech/sign to speech/sign translations, human-human communications mediated by computers, etc. Assessment of the above mentioned technologies is also an important area within LREC 2018.



Language Resources in the Online World

In a time in which more and more (language) data are generated, either by human beings or by machines, and directly streamed, the question arises how LRs and LTs can cope with this development. A first challenge is to address and to provide for correctives to hate speeches, cyberbullying, fake news, etc. Can LT provide means to process and respond in a timely manner to such language data streamed in a huge amount at high speed? In this context, language technologists have to intensify cooperation with humanities, especially social and political sciences, psychology but also economics, and more.





DESCRIBE AND SHARE YOUR LRs!

In addition to describing your LRs in the LRE Map – now a normal step in the submission procedure of many conferences – LREC recognises the importance of sharing resources and making them available to the community.

When submitting a paper, you will be offered the possibility to share your LRs (data, tools, web-services, etc.), uploading them in a special LREC repository set up by ELRA. Your LRs will be made available to all LREC participants before the conference, to be re-used, compared, analysed. This effort of sharing LRs, linked to the LRE Map for their description, contributes to creating a common repository where everyone can deposit and share data.



PROGRAMME

The Scientific Programme will include invited talks, oral presentations, poster and demo presentations, and panels, in addition to a keynote address by the winner of the Antonio Zampolli Prize.

We will also organise an Industrial Track.



SUBMISSIONS AND DATES

Submission of proposals for oral and poster (or poster+demo) papers: September 25, 2017

* LREC2018 asks for extended abstracts of no less than 3000 words (references excluded), which must strictly follow the LREC stylesheet which will be available on the conference website. Extended abstracts should be submitted through START and will be peer-reviewed.

Submission of proposals for panels, workshops and tutorials: September 25, 2017

* Proposals should be submitted via an online form on the LREC website and will be reviewed by the Programme Committee.



PROCEEDINGS

The Proceedings will include both oral and poster papers, in the same format. Final papers will range from 4 to 8 pages, with no difference in quality between shorter and longer submissions.

There is also no difference in quality between oral and poster presentations. Only the appropriateness of the type of communication (more or less interactive) to the content of the paper will be considered.

The importance of LREC in Natural Language Processing is reflected by the H5-Index citation ranking in Google Scholar: LREC is ranked 3rd among Computational Linguistics conferences. In addition, since 2010, LREC Proceedings are included in the Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index.

September 23rd 2013, Pisa, Italy, http://ldl2013.org



Collocated with the 6th Conference on Generative Approaches to the Lexicon (GL2013)





The explosion of information technology has led to a substantial growth in quantity, diversity and complexity of linguistic data accessible over the internet. The lack of interoperability between linguistic and language resources represents a major challenge that needs to be addressed, in particular, if information from different sources is to be combined, like, say, machine-readable lexicons, corpus data and terminology repositories. For these types of resources, domain-specific standards have been proposed, yet, issues of interoperability between different types of resources persist, commonly accepted strategies to distribute, access and integrate their information have yet to be established, and technologies and infrastructures to address both aspects are still under development.



The goal of the workshop is to assemble researchers from various fields of linguistics, natural language processing, and information technology to present and discuss principles, case studies, and best practices for representing, publishing and linking linguistic data collections, including corpora, dictionaries, lexical networks, translation memories, thesauri, etc., infrastructures developed on that basis, their use of existing standards, and the publication and distribution policies that were adopted.



We particularly invite contributions discussing the application of the Linked Open Data paradigm to linguistic data as it might provide an important step towards making linguistic data: i) easily and uniformly queryable, ii) interoperable and iii) sharable over the Web using open standards such as the HTTP protocol and the RDF data model [1]. Recent research in this direction has lead to the emergence of a Linked Open Data cloud of linguistic resources, the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud, where Linked Data principles were applied to language resources, allowing them to be published and linked in a principled way [2]. Although not restricted to lexical resources, these play a particularly prominent role in this context [3].



The intended audience includes computational linguists and NLP engineers interested in the application of Semantic Web formalisms and related technologies to language data, empirically-working linguists and lexicographers interested in the representation, exchange and interlinking of linguistic data and metadata, and developers of infrastructures for linguistic data and other researchers with an interest in both aspects. 



Background and History



LDL-2013 is organized in the context of two recent community efforts, the Open Linguistics Working Group of the Open Knowledge Foundation (OWLG), and the W3C Ontology-Lexica Community Group. The Open Linguistics Working Group has spearheaded the creation of new data and the republishing of existing linguistic resources as linked open data. Similarly, the W3C Ontology-Lexica Community Group is seeking to develop standard models for representing and publishing (ontology-) lexica and other lexical resources as RDF.



The workshop is continuing a series of workshops on the application of the Linked Data paradigm to linguistic data that have been initiated and organized by the Open Linguistics Working Group: The First Workshop on Linked Data in Linguistics (LDL-2012) was conducted in March 2012 at the University of Frankfurt am Main/Germany, and collocated with the 34th Annual Meeting of the German Linguistics Society (DGfS-2012). The Workshop on Multilingual Linked Open Data for Enterprises (MLODE-2012) was conducted in September 2012 at the University of Leipzig/Germany, and collocated with the 3rd Conference on Software Agents and Services for Business, Research and E-Science (SABRE-2012). We intend to continue both series of workshops, with LDL workshops being attached to (computational) linguistic venues, and MLODE workshops co-located with information technology events.



Topics of Interest



We invite contributions related (but not limited) to the following topics:

1. Use cases and project proposals for the creation, maintenance and publication of linguistic data collections that are linked with other resources

2. Modelling linguistic data and metadata with OWL and/or RDF

3. Ontologies for linguistic data and metadata collections

4. Applications of such data, other ontologies or linked data from any subdiscipline of linguistics (may include work in progress or project descriptions)

5. Descriptions of data sets, ideally following Linked Data principles

6. Legal and social aspects of Linguistic Linked Open Data





Submission & Publication



We accept submission of both long (up to 8 pages plus 2 pages for references) and short papers (up to 4 pages plus 2 pages for references) to be presented as long or short oral presentation at the workshop. The papers of the workshop will be published as CEUR proceedings. In addition, we aim for a journal special issue as post-conference proceedings in which a selected amount of papers presented at the workshop will be published.

CodiEsp (eHealth CLEF– Multilingual Information Extraction) Shared Task on automatic assignment of ICD10 codes (procedures, diagnosis) track at CLEF 2020 

http://temu.bsc.es/codiesp 

 

Plan TL Award for the CodiEsp Track 

 

 

The CodiEsp sub-tracks: 

 

1.CodiEsp Diagnosis Coding sub-task (CodiEsp-D): will require automatic ICD10-CM [CIE10 Diagnóstico] code assignment. 

2.CodiEsp Procedure Coding sub-task (CodiEsp-P): will require automatic ICD10-PCS [CIE10 Procedimiento] code assignment. 

3.CodiEsp Explainable AI Subtask (CodiEsp-X). Systems are required to submit the reference to the predicted codes (both ICD10-CM and ICD10-PCS). 





Task description

Clinical coding consists in the transformation (or classification) of medical texts written by clinicians into a structured or coded format using internationally recognized class codes. 

These codes describe a patient’s diagnosis or treatment. This process is critical for standardizing clinical records; enable aetiology studies, monitor health trends, epidemiology studies, clinical and biomedical research, decision-making or even re-imbursement.

 

Due to the importance of this process, there are now even specialized education programs and professional occupations of persons employed as clinical coders or medical records technicians.

   

 

As part of the eHealth CLEF (http://clef-ehealth.org) Multilingual Information Extraction Shared Task we organize CodiEsp: Clinical Case Coding Task (http://temu.bsc.es/codiesp). This task will address the automatic extraction and assigment of clinical coding (diagnosis and procedures) to clinical cases in Spanish. 



In addition data in Spanish we will also release training, development and test set document translations into English.



 

Participant systems have to automatically assign ICD10 codes (CIE-10, in Spanish) to clinical case documents, being evaluated against manually generated ICD10 codifications. 

 

In addition to the Spanish data we will also include training, development and test set documents automatically translated into English.

 

Following the success of previous eHealth CLEF efforts or medical text mining tasks like MEDDOCAN or PharmaCoNER, we foresee that this task will be influential not only in terms of determining the most competitive approaches which might range from sophisticated term look-up to multi-class document classification systems using machine learning approaches.

Submissions

We solicit three categories of papers: regular workshop papers, extended abstracts and cross-submissions. Only regular workshop papers will be included in the proceedings as archival publications, and only regular workshop papers will be eligible for best paper prizes. All three categories of papers may be long (maximum 8 pages plus references) or short (maximum 4 pages plus references). All submissions should be in PDF format and made through the Softconf website set up for this workshop: https://www.softconf.com/acl2021/w15_repl4nlp2021/.

In line with the ACL main conference policy, camera-ready versions of papers will be given one additional page of content, and no limit to additional pages for references.\

Regular Workshop Papers

Authors should submit a long paper of up to 8 pages, or a short paper of up to 4 pages, both with unlimited references, following the ACL 2021 formatting requirements (see the ACL 2021 Call For Papers for reference: https://2021.aclweb.org/calls/papers/). The reported research should be substantially original. Accepted papers will be presented as posters. Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information should be included in the papers; self-reference that identifies the authors should be avoided or anonymized. Accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings.

Supplementary Material: Each submission can be accompanied by a single PDF appendix. The paper submissions need to remain fully self-contained, as these supplementary materials are completely optional, and reviewers are not even asked to review or download them. Supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.



Extended Abstracts

Preliminary but interesting ideas or results that have not been published before may be submitted as extended abstracts. Accepted extended abstracts will be presented as posters, and included in the workshop program and handbook, but will not be included in the workshop proceedings (and are not eligible for best paper prizes). 

Extended abstract submissions are therefore ideal for preliminary work which would benefit from exposure but is not ready for publication. Authors should submit a long extended abstract of up to 8 pages, or a short extended abstract of up to 4 pages, both with unlimited references. Submissions should follow the ACL 2021 formatting requirements (see the ACL 2021 Call For Papers for reference: https://2021.aclweb.org/calls/papers/). Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information should be included in the papers; self-reference that identifies the authors should be avoided or anonymized.



Cross-Submissions

In addition to previously unpublished work, we also solicit recent papers on relevant topics that have appeared in a non-NLP venue (e.g., workshop or conference papers at NeurIPS or ICML). Accepted cross-submissions will be presented as posters, with an indication of original venue, but will not be included in the workshop program and handbook, or the workshop proceedings (and are not eligible for best paper prizes). Cross-submissions are ideal for related work which would benefit from exposure to the RepL4NLP audience. Submission length is determined by the original venue. Interested authors should submit their papers in PDF format through the RepL4NLP Softconf website (https://www.softconf.com/acl2021/w15_repl4nlp2021/), with a note on the original venue. Papers in this category do not need to follow the ACL format and selection will be solely determined by the organizing committee.

**Submission deadline has been extended until 4 June, 2017**



You are invited to participate in the 2nd Joint Workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced IR and NLP for Digital Libraries (BIRNDL), to be held as part of 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2017) in Tokyo, Japan on 11th August 2017.



We are happy to announce that the past BIR and NLPIR4DL organizers are proposing this workshop at SIGIR together. In conjunction with the BIRNDL workshop, we will hold the 3rd CL-SciSumm Shared Task in Scientific Document Summarization.



Reports from the shared task systems will be featured as part of a session at the workshop.



Aim of the Workshop

The BIRNDL workshop is the first step to foster a reflection on interdisciplinarity, and the benefits that the disciplines bibliometrics, IR and NLP can derive from it in a digital libraries context. The workshop is intended to stimulate IR researchers and digital library professionals to elaborate on new approaches in natural language processing, information retrieval, scientometrics, text mining and recommendation techniques that can advance the state-of-the-art in scholarly document understanding, analysis, and retrieval at scale. Researchers are in need of assistive technologies to track developments in an area, identify the approaches used to solve a research problem over time and summarize research trends. Digital libraries require semantic search, question-answering and automated recommendation and reviewing systems to manage and retrieve answers from scholarly databases. Full document text analysis can help to design semantic search, translation and summarization systems; citation and social network analyses can help digital libraries to visualize scientific trends, bibliometrics and relationships and influences of works and authors. All these approaches can be supplemented with the metadata supplied by digital libraries, inclusive of usage data, such as download counts.



We invite papers and presentations that incorporate insights from IR, bibliometrics and NLP to develop new techniques to address the open problems in Big Science, such as evidence-based searching, measurement of research quality, relevance and impact, the emergence and decline of research problems, identification of scholarly relationships and influences and applied problems such as language translation, question-answering and summarization. Finding relevant scholarly literature is key point of the workshop and sets the agenda for tools and approaches to be discussed and evaluated at BIRNDL. At the workshop, we would also like to address the need for established, standardized baselines, evaluation metrics and test collections.



See the proceedings of the first BIRNDL workshop at JCDL 2016 and a recent report in SIGIR Forum.

This workshop will be relevant to scholars in computer and information science, specialized in IR, bibliometrics and NLP. The Shared Task is expected to be of interest to a broad community including those working in CL and NLP, especially in the sub-disciplines of text summarization, discourse structure in scholarly discourse, paraphrase, textual entailment and text simplification. The workshop will also be of importance for all stakeholders in the publication pipeline: implementers, publishers and policymakers. Formal citation metrics are increasingly a factor in decision-making by universities and funding bodies worldwide, making the need for research in applying these metrics more pressing. Today's publishers continue to provide new ways to support their consumers in disseminating and retrieving the right published works to their audience. Even when only considering the scholarly sites within Computer Science, we find that the field is well-represented - ACM Portal, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, PSU's CiteSeerX, MSR's Academic Search, Elsevier’s Mendeley, Tsinghua's ArnetMiner, Trier's DBLP, Hiroshima's PRESRI; with this workshop we hope to bring a number of these contributors together.



Workshop Topics



We invite stimulating as well as unpublished submissions on topics including - but not limited to - full-text analysis, multimedia and multilingual analysis and alignment as well as the application of citation-based NLP or information retrieval and information seeking techniques in digital libraries. Specific examples of fields of interests include (but are not limited to):



- Infrastructure for scientific mining and IR

- Semantic and Network-based indexing, navigation, searching and browsing in structured data

- Discourse structure identification and argument mining from scientific papers

- Summarisation and question-answering for scholarly DLs;

- Bibliometrics, citation analysis and network analysis for IR

- Task based user modelling, interaction, and personalisation

- Recommendation for scholarly papers, reviewers, citations and publication venues

- Measurement and evaluation of quality and impact

- Metadata and controlled vocabularies for resource description and discovery; Automatic metadata discovery, such as language identification

- Disambiguation issues in scholarly DLs using NLP or IR techniques; Data cleaning and data quality



For the paper sessions, we especially invite descriptions of running projects and ongoing work as well as contributions from industry. Papers that investigate multiple themes directly are especially welcome.



The CL-SciSumm Shared Task

http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/cl-scisumm2017



The 3rd Computational Linguistics (CL) Scientific Summarization Shared Task is sponsored by Microsoft Research Asia and will be conducted as a part of this workshop. This is the first medium-scale shared task on scientific document summarization in the computational linguistics domain. The current shared task will be on automatic paper summarization in the Computational Linguistics (CL) domain. The output summaries will be of two types: faceted summaries of the traditional self-summary (the abstract) and the community summary (the collection of citation sentences ‘citances’). We also propose to group the citances by the facets of the text that they refer to.



This task follows up on the successful CLScisumm-2016 task @ JCDL 2016, Newark, NJ, USA and a Pilot Task conducted as a part of the BiomedSumm Track at the Text Analysis Conference 2014 (TAC 2014). In this task, a training corpus of ten topics from CL research papers was released. Participants were invited to enter their systems in a task-based evaluation.



The CLSciSumm17 corpus is expected to be of interest to a broad community including those working in computational linguistics and natural language processing, text summarization, discourse structure in scholarly discourse, paraphrase, textual entailment and text simplification.

About this Workshop

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In recent years, information channels have become increasingly distributed, 

opinionated, and vary in their information quality and trustworthiness of the 

stated facts and arguments. Comprehensive understanding, sense-making and informed 

discussions within a society require advanced technologies in natural language 

processing, text mining, information retrieval, and provenance analytics.

 

The development of advanced retrieval solutions requires the understanding and the 

combination of methods from different research areas, including machine learning, 

data mining, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, user interaction 

and modeling, Web engineering, and Big Data processing. This workshop provides a 

platform for presenting and discussing new solutions, novel ideas, or specific tools

in this regard. The following list organizes classic and recent topics for which 

contributions are welcome, but not limited to:





- Theory. Retrieval models, similarity measures, formal analysis



- Evaluation. Corpus construction, experiment design, performance measures



- Information Quality and Provenance. Text quality assessment, text reuse, trust 

  and author reputation, provenance analytics



- Natural Language Processing. Opinion mining, text summarization and simplification, 

  question answer-ing, discourse and argument mining



- Personalization. Personalized retrieval, context detection, user profiling, 

  user modeling

  

- Search User Interfaces. General purpose search, special purpose search, 

  adaptive interfaces, retrieval in cognitive settings



- Web Search. Ranking and recommendation, query classification and segmentation, 

  vertical search, dynamic taxonomy generation



- Social Media Analytics. People analytics, social network analysis, trend analysis



- Semantic Web. Meta data analysis and tagging, knowledge extraction, 

  inference and linking



- Deep Learning. Representation learning for text





The workshop is held for the fourteenth time. In the past, it was characterized by a 

stimulating atmosphere, and it attracted high quality contributions from all over the world.

Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of DEXA’17 Workshops published by

 The purpose of the conference series International Workshop on Computational

Linguistics for Uralic Languages is to bring together researchers working on

computational approaches to working with these languages. We accept long and

short papers as well as tutorial proposals working on the following languages:

Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian, Võro, the Sámi languages, Komi (Zyrian, Permyak),

Mordvin (Erzya, Moksha), Mari (Hill, Meadow), Udmurt, Nenets (Tundra, Forest),

Enets, Nganasan, Selkup, Mansi, Khanty, Veps, Karelian (Olonets), Karelian,

Ingrian (Izhorian), Votic, Livonian, Ludic, and other related languages.

 All Uralic languages exhibit rich morphological structure, which makes

processing them challenging for state-of-the-art computational linguistic

approaches, the majority also suffer from a lack of resources and many are

endangered.



 Research papers should be original, substantial and unpublished research, that

can describe work-in-progress systems, frameworks, standards and evaluation

schemes. Demos and tutorials will present systems and standards towards the goal

of interoperability and unification of different projects, applications and

research groups Appropriate topics include (but are not limited to):



 * Parsers, analysers and processing pipelines of Uralic languages

* Lexical databases, electronic dictionaries

* Finished end-user applications aimed at Uralic languages, such as spelling or

  grammar checkers, machine translation or speech processing

* Evaluation methods and gold standards, tagged corpora, treebanks

* Reports on language-independent or unsupervised methods as applied to Uralic

  languages

* Surveys and review articles on subjects related to computational linguistics

  for one or more Uralic languages

* Any work that aims at combining efforts and reducing duplication of work

* How to elicit activity from the language community, agitation campaigns, games

  with a purpose



 To maximise the possibility of reproducibility, replication and reuse, we

particularly encourage submissions which present free/open-source language

resources and make use of free/open-source software.  One of the aims of this

gathering is to avoid unnecessary duplicated work in field of Uralistics by

establishing connections and interoperability standards between researchers and

research groups working at different sites. We have also identified a serious

lack of gold standards and evaluation metrics for all Uralic languages including

those with national support, any work towards better resources in these fields

will be greatly appreciated.



 In this year’s edition, we encourage people to present comparative evaluations

of different NLP methods as applied to Uralic languages. With all the buzz around

neural and deep-learning methods: Are they applicable to Uralic languages, which

in general have very little training data --- even monolingual data --- and also

richer morphology than the more widely treated Indo-European languages."

14th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON 

COGNITIVE COMPUTING AND DATA-DRIVEN BUSINESS

September 16-19, 2014, Graz, Austria 



CALL FOR WORKSHOPS





i-KNOW 2014 invites interested researchers to submit workshop proposals

on topics relevant to cognitive computing, knowledge technologies, (big)

data analytics, and data-driven business. Since 2001, i-KNOW has

successfully brought together leading researchers and developers from

these fields and attracted annually over 450 international attendees. 



i-KNOW 2014 aims at advancing research at the intersection of

disciplines such as Knowledge Discovery, Semantics, Information

Visualization, Visual Analytics, Social (Semantic) and Ubiquitous

Computing. The goal of integrating these approaches is to create

cognitive computing systems that will enable humans to utilize massive

amounts of data.

We are specifically interested in the integration of data-centric and

user-centric approaches and welcome contributions from both ends of the

spectrum. You will find the conference website at

http://www.i-know.at/	



Note to i-KNOW veterans: For the past 13 years, i-KNOW has focused on

knowledge technologies which build the basis for knowledge management.

In the light of new trends such as big data and the massive utilization

of mobile devices we think it is time to embrace new developments in

order to create systems which ""interact naturally with humans, learn

from their experiences and generate and evaluate evidence-based

hypotheses"". That is, we interpret cognitive computing as the

convergence of various knowledge technologies research fields. On the

other hand, data-driven business represents the business perspective on

cognitive computing and takes application specific knowledge (such as

semantics) into account. 



Collocated Conferences: We are proud to announce that EC-TEL 2014

(European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning) will this year be

organized co-located to i-KNOW in Graz. Therefore, we are also

specifically interested in workshops which bridge the two conferences. 



Workshops at i-KNOW should form distinguished meeting points for

discussing ongoing work on 

- research topics at the intersection of different knowledge technology

  disciplines (such as Knowledge Discovery, Semantics, Information

  Visualization, Visual Analytics, Social (Semantic) and Ubiquitous

  Computing)  

- data-driven business approaches to specific application domains (such

  as Life Sciences, Smart Mobility and Energy, Science 2.0 and Open

  Science, Digital Libraries)



Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):



- Algorithmic and technological developments in knowledge discovery,

  information retrieval and social computing

- Visual interfaces and human computer interaction for knowledge

  analysis and computing

- Natural language processing on the Web and corresponding evaluation

  initiatives 

- Applications and scientific competitions of machine learning in

  engineering, Life Sciences, and knowledge management

- Algorithmic developments and applications of semantic web technologies

  and linked data engineering in general as well as in specific domains

- Digital libraries and Science 2.0

- Multimedia-centered knowledge technologies

- Algorithmic developments and applications of social computing and

  ubiquitous personal computing

- Graphical recommender systems and adaptive systems

- Real-time assistance using augmented reality, context-aware computing

  and ubiquitous visual analytics

- Shared tasks on natural language processing 

- Ubiquitous personal computing supporting learning and creativity

- Computer-supported work and learning



---------- GENERAL INFORMATION AND CRITERIA -------------



Each proposal will be reviewed by the members of the program

committee, and ranked based on the overall quality of the proposal and

the workshop's fit to the conference as detailed below. Workshop

duration can be half a day or a full day.



The criteria for judging the quality of workshop proposals are as

follows:

- Workshops cover topics falling in the general scope of the i-KNOW

  conference.

- Workshops are intended to be genuine interactive events and not

  mini-conferences.

- We welcome workshops with creative structures and organizations that

  attract various types of contributions and ensure rich interactions.

- Workshops should have a clear focus on a specific technology, problem

  or application.

- There is potentially a significant community interested in the

  workshop's topic.

- We strongly advise having more than one organizer and no more than

  four, preferably from different institutions, bringing different

  perspectives to the workshop topic.



---------- ORGANIZATION OF WORKSHOP ----------------------



In case overlapping workshops are proposed, the workshop chair may

contact the organizers to discuss the possibility of merging workshops.

Please note that the duration of a workshop might need to be adjusted

based on the overall number of submissions received. Workshops that

receive less than 5 submissions or have less than 10 people registered

at the early registration deadline might be cancelled.

The organizers of accepted workshops will be responsible for their own

reviewing process, publicity (e.g., website, timelines and call for

papers), and proceedings production. They will be required to closely

cooperate with the Workshop Chair and the i-KNOW 2014 organizers to

finalize all organizational details. 



---------- REGISTRATION FEES -----------------------------

Paper Submission Deadline: March 7, 2014 (11:59pm PST)



This workshop is held in conjunction with ACL 2014.





General Invitation For Submission



The Student Research Workshop at ACL conferences provides a venue for student researchers to present their work in computational linguistics and natural language processing. The students receive feedback from the general conference audience as well as from mentors specifically assigned according to the topic of the work. 



We invite papers in two categories. 

Thesis Proposals: This category is appropriate for advanced students who have decided on a thesis topic and wish to get feedback on their proposal and broader ideas for their continuing work.

Research Papers: Papers in this category can describe completed work or work in progress with preliminary results.



Topics



Areas of interest for the Student Research Workshop are the same as the ACL main conference. Please see the list of topics here.





Format Of The Workshop



All the accepted papers will be presented in the main conference poster session giving the opportunity for students to interact and present their work to a large and diverse audience. Each paper is also assigned a mentor, an experienced researcher who will provide feedback on the work. 



In addition, we will have a separate session at the main conference where student authors of the thesis proposal papers will give oral presentations of their thesis topic. Each student presentation is approximately 20 min.



We hope that this additional venue will enable the students to interact with the mentors as well as with other student participants.





Submission Requirements



Please check the submission guidelines.





Pre-submission Mentoring



ACL also provides a program for students to receive feedback on the writing for their paper before the conference deadline. An experienced researcher will read the paper and provide comments on how to improve the presentation of the work. This service is provided with the aim to improve the quality of writing in the student paper rather than focus on reviewing the work done. The mentor at this point does not correspond to the reviewer of the paper. 



Participation in this program is voluntary. Students who wish to participate should apply for the pre-submission mentoring service and submit abstracts for their papers no later than January 10. The students who apply for the pre-submission mentoring service will be required to submit their papers by January 17. They will receive feedback within 2 weeks. The feedback is intended to guide the student to revise the paper and the changes noted are not mandatory to make.





Schedule



The papers must be submitted by March 7. No papers received after this deadline will be accepted. Notification of acceptance will be sent to authors (by email) by April 4. Detailed formatting guidelines for the preparation of the final camera-ready copy will be provided to authors with their acceptance notice.



The Student Research Workshop will be held during the ACL 2014 main conference.

Overview 

 The 17th International Conference on Computing and Information Technology takes place at a time of rapid and unprecedented change that has long since rendered trusty benchmarks like Moore’s law irrelevant. To quote best-selling author and engineer Christopher Steiner, “algorithms have already written symphonies as moving as Beethoven, picker through legalese with the deftness of a senior lawyer and written news articles with the smooth hand of a seasoned reporter”. Indeed, it may not be long before an algorithm joins the Board of a venture capital firm (outperforming its humanoid peers, naturally). Key the many of these achievements stem from research in the areas of artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, speech recognition, and image processing among others that have already delivered solutions to the complex user and societal problems: helping architects design environmentally sustainable, structurally challenging and aesthetically interesting buildings; allowing scientists to split atoms and categorize human genomes; and enabling engineers to 3D print autonomous cars to name but a few. Such advances mirror changing economies, increasingly dominated by globalization and competition where constant high-speed innovation is now the only strategy that matters.

                       Last Call for Papers



18th Annual Conference of the European Association for Machine

Translation (EAMT 2015; Antalya, Turkey)

---------------------------------------------------------------------



The European Association for Machine Translation

(EAMT,http://www.eamt.org) invites everyone interested in machine

translation, translation-related tools and resources to participate in

this conference -- developers, researchers, users, professional

translators and translation/localisation managers: anyone who has a

stake in the vision of an information world in which language barriers

and issues become less visible to the information consumer. We

especially invite researchers to describe the state of the art and

demonstrate their cutting-edge results, and professional MT users to

share their experiences.



EAMT 2015, the 18th Annual Conference of the European Association for

Machine Translation, will be held in Antalya, Turkey from 11 to 13 May

2015.



We expect to receive manuscripts in these three categories:



-------------------------------------------------------------

(R) Research papers

-------------------------------------------------------------

Long-paper submissions (8 pages) are invited for reports of

significant research results in any aspect of machine translation and

related areas. Such reports should include a substantial evaluation

component, or have a strong theoretical and/or methodological

contribution where results and in-depth evaluations may not be

appropriate. Papers are welcome on all topics in the area of machine

translation or translation-related technologies, including:



* Speech translation: speech to text, speech to speech

* Translation aids (translation memory, terminology databases, etc.)

* Translation environments (workflow, support tools, conversion tools

  for lexica, etc.)

* Practical MT systems (MT for professionals, MT for multilingual

  eCommerce, MT for localization, etc.)

* MT in multilingual public service (eGovernment etc.)

* MT for the web

* MT embedded in other services

* MT evaluation techniques and evaluation results

* Dictionaries and lexica for MT

* Text and speech corpora for MT

* Standards in text and lexicon encoding for MT

* Human factors in MT and user interfaces

* Related multilingual technologies (natural language generation,

  information retrieval, text categorization, text summarization,

  information extraction, etc.)



Papers should describe original work. They should emphasize completed

work rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state

of completion of the reported results. Where appropriate, concrete

evaluation results should be included.



-------------------------------------------------------------

(U) User studies

-------------------------------------------------------------

Short-paper submissions (2-4 pages) are invited for reports on users'

experiences with MT, be it in small or medium size business (SMB),

enterprise, government, or NGOs. Contributions are welcome on:



* Integrating MT and computer-assisted translation into a translation

  production workflow (e.g. transforming terminology glossaries into

  MT resources, optimizing TM/MT thresholds, mixing online and offline

  tools, using interactive MT, dealing with MT confidence scores);

* Use of MT to improve translation or localization workflows

  (e.g. reducing turnaround times, improving translation consistency,

  increasing the scope of globalization projects);

* Managing change when implementing and using MT (e.g. switching

  between multiple MT systems, limiting degradations when updating or

  upgrading an MT system);

* Implementing open-source MT in the SMB or enterprise

  (e.g. strategies to get support, reports on taking pilot results

  into full deployment, examples of advance customisation sought and

  obtained thanks to the open-source paradigm, collaboration within

  open-source MT projects);

* Evaluation of MT in a real-world setting (e.g. error detection

  strategies employed, metrics used, productivity or translation

  quality gains achieved);

* Post-editing strategies and tools (e.g. limitations of traditional

  translation quality assurance tools, challenges associated with

  post-editing guidelines);

* Legal issues associated with MT, especially MT in the cloud

  (e.g. copyright, privacy);

* Use of MT in social networking or real-time communication

  (e.g. enterprise support chat, multilingual content for social

  media);

* Use of MT to process multilingual content for assimilation purposes

  (e.g. cross-lingual information retrieval, MT for e-discovery or

  spam detection, MT for highly dynamic content);

* Use of standards for MT.



Papers should highlight problems and solutions and not merely describe

MT integration process or project settings. Where solutions do not

seem to exist, suggestions for MT researchers and developers should be

clearly emphasized. For user papers produced by academics, we require

co-authorship with the actual users.

Call For Papers



EMNLP PrivateNLP is a full day workshop taking place on Monday, November 20, 2020 in conjunction with EMNLP 2020.



Workshop website: https://sites.google.com/view/privatenlp/



Important Dates:



• Submission Deadline: September 4, 2020

• Acceptance Notification: September 25, 2020

• Camera-ready versions: October 10, 2020

• Workshop: November 20, 2020





Privacy-preserving data analysis has become essential in the age of Machine Learning (ML) where access to vast amounts of data can provide gains over tuned algorithms. A large proportion of user-contributed data comes from natural language e.g., text transcriptions from voice assistants.



It is therefore important to curate NLP datasets while preserving the privacy of the users whose data is collected, and train ML models that only retain non-identifying user data.



The workshop aims to bring together practitioners and researchers from academia and industry to discuss the challenges and approaches to designing, building, verifying, and testing privacy preserving systems in the context of Natural Language Processing.





Topics of interest include but are not limited to:



* Privacy preserving machine learning for language models

* Generating privacy preserving test sets

* Inference and identification attacks

* Generating Differentially private derived data

* NLP, privacy and regulatory compliance

* Private Generative Adversarial Networks

* Privacy in Active Learning and Crowdsourcing

* Privacy and Federated Learning in NLP

* User perceptions on privatized personal data

* Auditing provenance in language models

* Continual learning under privacy constraints

* NLP and summarization of privacy policies

* Ethical ramifications of AI/NLP in support of usable privacy

* Homomorphic encryption for language models

Call for Papers

************************



With the rise of social media, emoji have become an extremely popular form of communication in social media. They are equally popular across major social media sites including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. As of 2017, Facebook and Facebook Messenger process over 60 million and 6 billion messages with emoji per day, respectively. In 2015, Instagram reported that nearly half of the photo comments posted on Instagram contains emoji and Instagram users tend to replace slang terms using emoji in photo comments. Another study revealed that emoji are slowly taking over emoticons on Twitter. Emoji data generated on social media sites have been utilized to study how emoji are used across different languages, cultures, user communities and as features to learn machine learning models to solve problems that span across many applications, including sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, and sarcasm detection. The ability to automatically process, derive meaning, and interpret text fused with emoji will be essential as society embraces emoji as a standard form of online communication. Thus, Emoji2018 tries to bring together computer and social science researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to discuss and exchange ideas on understanding social, cultural, communicative, and linguistic roles of emoji while leading the discussions on building novel computational methods to understand and interpret them.



Emoji2018 is focused on research and discussions on challenges in emoji understanding, including but not limited to the following research directions.



Challenges in interpreting the meaning of an emoji in a message context 

Novel methods for emoji sense disambiguation 

Novel methods for calculating emoji similarity 

Novel methods for emoji prediction 

Challenges in using emoji as a language 

Emoji’s effects on the evolution of language constructs used on social media such as emoticons and slang terms 

Common emoji usages in social media 

Cultural and community-specific emoji meaning evolution and interpretation 

Why emoji meanings change over time and across communities? 

Distinct social and communicative roles of emoji 

How do people come to understandings of the meanings of the emoji? 

Understanding sender intention and receiver interpretation of emoji 

Emoji rendering and interface design challenges 

Applications of emoji in social media 

Research related to other pictorial representations such as emotes, customized emoji (e.g., bitmoji), and animated gifs.





We encourage submissions that utilize quantitative, qualitative and mixed research methods to approach the above challenges as contributions. We invite regular technical papers (8 pages), short papers (4 pages), and demo proposals (2 page). Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for this workshop. Submissions will be evaluated by the program committee based on the quality of the work and its fit to the workshop themes. All submissions should be double-blind and use the Emoji2018 LaTeX template (based on CEUR-WS templates) available at http://knoesis.org/resources/Emoji2018/Emoji2018_LaTeX_Template.zip for formatting. A high-resolution PDF of the paper should be uploaded to the EasyChair submission site at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=emoji2018 before the paper submission deadline. Emoji2018 Workshop proceedings will be submitted to CEUR-WS.org for online publication.

Arabic NLP: Current State and Future Challenges



About the Journal:

The Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences (CIS) is produced and hosted by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University (KSU). The CIS Journal publishes peer-reviewed research articles in computer and information sciences; it was founded in 1994 and is published in http://ees.elsevier.com/jksu-cis/.



Abstract:

Arabic is a member of the Semitic languages family that uses a distinct alphabet set and spoken by more than 340 million individuals as their first language. It is the official language, either solely or jointly, in twenty countries located in the Middle East and Africa. Arabic is the language of the Holly Qur’aan and one of the six official languages of the United Nations.



Arabic Natural language processing (NLP) is still in its initial stage compared to the work in English and other languages. NLP is made possible by the collaboration of many disciplines including computer science, linguistics, mathematics, psychology and artificial intelligence. The results of which are highly beneficial for many applications such as machine translation, Information Retrieval, Information Extraction, text summarization and Question Answering. 



This special issue of CCIS Journal is intended to present the current state of research on Arabic NLP, Arabic computational linguistics, and related areas. We welcome unpublished high quality papers (in English) on current state of Arabic NLP including, but not limited to:

• Part of Speech Tagging 

• Morphological analysis and generation 

• Word sense and Syntactic disambiguation

Call for Papers



The 1st Workshop on Knowledge Base Construction, Reasoning and Mining (KBCOM) is a new workshop that will be co-located with WSDM 2018. The success of data mining and search technologies is largely attributed to the efficient and effective analysis of structured data. Automated construction, mining and reasoning of knowledge bases and graphs have become possible as research advances in many related areas such as information extraction, natural language processing, machine learning and databases. KBCOM aims to gather together leading experts from industry and academia to share their visions about the field, discuss latest research results, and exchange exciting ideas.



We aim to complement the main conference by trying to achieve the following goals:



Research horizons in KBCOM: The workshop focuses on invited talks from leading experts and position papers discussing forward-looking work. Its program comprises a good number of keynote speakers from both leading universities (Stanford, University of Washington and more) and industrial organizations like Amazon and Recruit Institute of Technology.



Idea exchange in KBCOM: We will organize a poster session for researchers to share ideas, collect feedbacks and form collaborations. We particularly encourage participants to publish new software and datasets on related topics, and will hold novel shared tasks to help develop a better community.



We expect the highlight of the workshop to be the discussions and brainstorming during invited talks and the poster session. The workshop will also accept regular submissions of original research or position/visionary papers which will be presented either as highlight talks or during the poster session. With such focuses, KBCOM aims to provide a vivid forum of discussion about knowledge base-related research.

While, only a few years ago, general-purpose applications and companies with a rather broad scope have been ubiquitous, now more and more niches and highly specific domains are being explored, both by academic and industrial research and also by enterprises and entrepreneurs. One of the specific domains that has been receiving a lot of attention recently are legal and regulatory information systems, among others, with regard to cross-border commerce, for example, within the European Union’s Digital Single Market but also in other areas and regions.



Of special interest in that regard is the recent hype around “regtech” (i.e., applying technologies to regulatory applications), the use of cognitive computing and language technologies to tackle the law (especially regarding the extraction of structured information from legal documents) and the adoption of semantic technologies for publishing legislative documents by the European institutions demonstrates that the next generation of intelligent applications is appearing in the legal domain.



These applications rely extensively on text resources and semantic web technologies. There is also a strong demand for high-quality, well described language resources, which can be used in the legal domain. Vast amounts of cases, rulings, laws, regulations, political programs, parliamentary debates and public opinions have been released in the last few years. However, we still don’t have a clear consensus or agreement of what the key characteristics, components and functionalities of the Legal Knowledge Graph should be. The language resources that should be used to populate the Legal Knowledge Graph are also a topic of current debates.



The proposed workshop is aimed at filling this crucial gap. In order to develop new products and services to assist lawyers and experts in the legal domain, a new type of interoperable language resources and technologies is necessary, aimed specifically at constructing the Legal Knowledge Graph.



Topics of interest



The 1st Legal KG Workshop invites research in language resources and technologies for the Legal Knowledge Graph, including but not limited to:



Resources in the legal domain such as: legislation, treaties, regulations, court decisions, case law (judgments, orders), international agreements or perparatory acts (legislative proposals, reports, etc.)

Resources in the political domain, such as political programs, parliament debates, etc.

Resources from the private law, such as contracts, agreements, etc.

Legal ontologies, vocabularies and thesauri

Technologies for handling resources in multiples languages from multiple jurisdictions

Localization of legal documents

Patterns in language and law

Automatic regulatory compliance systems

Applications of AI in the legal domain based on language resources

Legal text mining systems

Translation of legal documents

Methods of alignment of legislation with company workflows, public opinion, etc.

Any other research useful towards the Legal Knowledge Graph"

The 14th Annual Workshop of the Australian Language Technology Association (ALTA 2016) will be held on the 5th and 6th of December at Caulfield campus of Monash University, colocated with the Australian Document Computing Symposium. 

The ALTA 2016 workshop is the key local forum for socialising research results in natural language processing and computational linguistics, with presentations and posters from student, industry, and early-career researchers. 



The workshop also features invited keynote speakers and panelists and a shared task that encourages promising students to get involved in language technology research. 





# Format  



We invite submissions of two different formats: 





## Original Research Papers 



We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all aspects of natural language processing. Long papers should be 6-8 pages. Accepted long papers will have a 15 minute slot for oral presentation plus 5 minutes for questions and discussion. Short papers should be 3-4 pages. Accepted short papers will have a poster presentation plus a short approx. 5 minute talk to advertise the poster. Both formats may include up to 2 pages of references additional to these page count requirements. Note that the review process is double-blind, and accordingly submitted papers should not include the author identity and the text should be suitably anonymised, e.g., using third person wording for self-citations, not providing URLs to your person website, etc. 



Original research papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which will be published online in the ACL anthology and the ALTA website. Long papers will be distinguished from short papers in the proceedings. 





## Presentations 



To encourage broader participation and facilitate local socialisation of international results, we continue the presentations format introduced last year. We invite submissions of 1-2 page presentation abstracts. These will not be published in the proceedings, but simply reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to ensure that they are on topic, coherent and likely to be of interest to the ALTA community. Abstracts on work in progress and work published or submitted elsewhere are encouraged. ALTA invites submissions of all manner interesting research, not limited to, but including: 



- established academics giving an overview of an exciting paper or paper/s published in international venues; 

- completing research students giving an overview of their thesis work; 

- early candidature research students presenting their work-in-progress and ideas, which may not have been published; and 

industry presenting research and development over linguistic data in the context of their business. 



Presentation abstracts should not be anonymised, any publications relating to the work should be cited in the submission, and the person who will give the presentation should be clearly stated. Successful submissions will have a 15 or 30 minute slot for an oral presentation. Please nominate what length presentation you would prefer in your submission. 



# Topics 

ALTA invites the submission of papers and presentations on all aspects of natural language processing, including, but not limited to: 



- phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse;

We accept long and short papers as well as tutorial proposals working on the following languages: Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian, Võro, the Sámi languages, Komi (Zyrian, Permyak), Mordvin (Erzya, Moksha), Mari (Hill, Meadow), Udmurt, Nenets (Tundra, Forest), Enets, Nganasan, Selkup, Mansi, Khanty, Veps, Karelian (Olonets), Karelian, Ingrian (Izhorian), Votic, Livonian, Ludic, and other related languages. All Uralic languages exhibit rich morphological structure, which makes processing them challenging for state-of-the-art computational linguistic approaches, the majority also suffer from a lack of resources and many are endangered. Research papers should be original, substantial and unpublished research, that can describe work-in-progress systems, frameworks, standards and evaluation schemes. Demos and tutorials will present systems and standards towards the goal of interoperability and unification of different projects, applications and research groups Appropriate topics include (but are not limited to):



Parsers, analysers and processing pipelines of Uralic languages

Lexical databases, electronic dictionaries

Finished end-user applications aimed at Uralic languages, such as spelling or grammar checkers, machine translation or speech processing

Evaluation methods and gold standards, tagged corpora, treebanks

Reports on language-independent or unsupervised methods as applied to Uralic languages

Surveys and review articles on subjects related to computational linguistics for one or more Uralic languages

Any work that aims at combining efforts and reducing duplication of work

How to elicit activity from the language community, agitation campaigns, games with a purpose



To maximise the possibility of reproducibility, replication and reuse, we particularly encourage submissions which present free/open-source language resources and make use of free/open-source software. One of the aims of this gathering is to avoid unnecessary duplicated work in field of Uralistics by establishing connections and interoperability standards between researchers and research groups working at different sites. We have also identified a serious lack of gold standards and evaluation metrics for all Uralic languages including those with national support, any work towards better resources in these fields will be greatly appreciated."

SHARED TASK: Question Answering about Banking (sponsored by Capital One)





The task aims to explore whether existing Q&As that were posed and answered by humans, can be reused to answer novel test questions. Instead of returning an actual answer to each test question (which would require the synthesis of grammatically correct answers), the submitted systems are expected to return only three appropriate Q&As from a given corpus (focusing, thus, on the problem of identifying similarity, or entailment between questions). System responses will be evaluated by domain experts. A detailed description of the shared task can be found here: http://cognitum.ws





Prize: $1000 for the top-performing system, subject to minimum performance / participation conditions.

This area of research has been constantly gaining momentum and attention over the past few years as textual material become available in abundance (social networks and web content) and advanced computational power become accessible. This resulted in an interesting array of practical applications. This is evident in the number of conferences, conference tracks, workshops, special issues of journals dedicated to or issues related to ANLP. Another indication of this growing interest is the surge of papers, books, and other forms of publications related to NLP. Noticeably, deep learning is dominating NLP as it did to other areas of artificial intelligence. Deep learning is the modern application of earlier neural network technology but with multiple layers that made possible with modern computing technology. The application of deep learning technology to NLP is progressing at a fast pace, and it is anticipated that we will see many exciting new discoveries here in the next few years. Therefore, the objective of this workshop is to present current and future advances in NLP. Authors are encouraged to submit their original work, which is not submitted elsewhere, to this workshop.



Proceedings of the workshops will be published by the IEEE Conference Publishing Services (CPS) and will be submitted for inclusion in the IEEE-Xplore and the IEEE Computer Society (CSDL) digital libraries. Authors are encouraged to submit their original work, which is not submitted elsewhere, to this workshop. The topics of the workshop include but not limited to:



* Morphological analysis.

* Stemming, Tokenization, segmentation, chunking, parsing, POS.

* Information retrieval and extraction.

* Named Entity Recognition and Keyword extraction.

* Word embedding models.

* Text summarization and compression.

* Event extraction and semantic role labeling.

* Sentiment analysis and classification.

* Dialectal modeling.

* Machine translation.

* Deep learning applications.

* Speech recognition, synthesis, and speaker identification.

**NEW DEVELOPMENTS FOR THE SECOND CFP (ACL2020)**



We have several exciting and important developments in the ACL2020 conference that we want to highlight at the top of the second call for papers:



1) Reviewer and Author Profile Signup

2) Paper Templates

3) Theme

4) Dual Submission 

5) Publication Date





1) Special Instructions for Reviewer and Author Signup

As our field has grown considerably over the last five years, it is important that our reviewing process scales accordingly.  For the ACL2020 conference, we are creating a new review process with a goal to better manage conflict of interest (COI) and better match submissions with appropriate reviewers.  The big picture is that authors and reviewers must create or update a Global Profile and fill out the ACL2020 Reviewer/Author Information Form.  



Global Profile:  please fill out this form in order to compute conflicts of interest and better match papers with appropriate reviewers.  

https://www.softconf.com/acl2020/super/scmd.cgi?ucmd=updateProfile



ACL2020 Reviewer/Author Information Form: this allows us to better match papers with the best reviewers:

And the Overleaf template is also available here: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acl-2020-proceedings-template/zsrkcwjptpcd





3) Theme: As 2020 quickly approaches, we felt this was a great time to reflect on the state of the field of NLP, as well its future, with a special Theme track.  We hope you consider submitting a paper!  You can find details here:  https://acl2020.org/blog/theme/





4) Archival and Dual Submissions can be a bit tricky.  We outline what is acceptable and what isn’t on this blog:  https://acl2020.org/blog/arxiv-papers-double-submissions/  





5) Publication Date:   The official publication date is June 19, 2020, just over two weeks before the conference begins.  On this date the proceedings are made available in the ACL Anthology, and will be indicated as such in the ACL Anthology bibliographic records.  The official publication date may affect the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACL Anthology after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)





**CALL FOR PAPERS - MAIN CONFERENCE**



The 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2020) invites the submission of long and short papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing.

ACL 2020 Theme: Taking Stock of Where We’ve Been and Where We’re Going



The last few years have witnessed an unprecedented growth in NLP since the field began over sixty years ago.  The availability of large amounts of data and computing resources have led to new models and representations and exciting results on many NLP benchmark tasks. SOTA systems have approached human performance on several benchmark tasks.  As we embrace these new exciting results and advances, ACL 2020 is particularly interested in papers that can provide insights for the community to assess how much we have accomplished in developing a machine’s ability in understanding and generating human language and how far we are pushing the boundaries as a field given the long history of NLP research.  



Potential submissions of interest include (but not limited to) position papers, empirical/theoretical papers that: 



Reflect on the progress of the field or a sub-topic area from a larger spectrum and make connections and/or comparisons between the past and the present to provide a holistic view on where we stand today with respect to the past;

Examine, analyze, and interpret SOTA models and results to shed light on limitations as well as key advances that may have lasting impact;  

Bring novel ideas for advancing the field, e.g., to enable and measure machine’s ability in language processing beyond laboratory benchmarks; 



We anticipate to have a special session for this theme at the conference and a best Thematic Paper Award in addition to the traditional Best Paper Awards.

PAPER SUBMISSION INFORMATION



Long Papers



Long paper submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Review forms will be made available prior to the deadlines.



Long papers may consist of up to 8 pages of content, plus unlimited references; final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.



Long papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and which as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings between long papers presented orally and as posters.





Short Papers



Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages. Some kinds of short papers are:



-A small, focused contribution

-A negative result

-An opinion piece

-An interesting application nugget



Short papers may consist of up to 4 pages of content, plus unlimited references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given 5 content pages in the proceedings. Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address reviewers' comments in their final versions.



Short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers presented orally and as posters.





IMPORTANT: Anonymity Period



The following rules and guidelines are meant to protect the integrity of double-blind review and ensure that submissions are reviewed fairly. The rules make reference to the anonymity period, which runs from 1 month before the submission deadline (starting November 9, 2019 11:59PM UTC-12:00) up to the date when your paper is either accepted, rejected, or withdrawn (April 3, 2020).



You may not make a non-anonymized version of your paper available online to the general community (for example, via a preprint server) during the anonymity period. By a version of a paper we understand another paper having essentially the same scientific content but possibly differing in minor details (including title and structure) and/or in length (e.g., an abstract is a version of the paper that it summarizes).



If you have posted a non-anonymized version of your paper online before the start of the anonymity period, you may submit an anonymized version to the conference. The submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version, and you must inform the program chair(s) that a non-anonymized version exists. 



You may not update the non-anonymized version during the anonymity period, and we ask you not to advertise it on social media or take other actions that would further compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period.



Note that, while you are not prohibited from making a non-anonymous version available online before the start of the anonymity period, this does make double-blind reviewing more difficult to maintain, and we therefore encourage you to wait until the end of the anonymity period if possible. Alternatively, you may consider submitting your work to the Computational Linguistics journal, which does not require anonymization and has a track for ""short"" (i.e., conference-length) papers.





Instructions for Double-Blind Review



As reviewing will be double blind, papers must not include authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references or links (such as github) that reveal the author's identity, e.g., ""We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."" must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ""Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."" Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.



Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents that are not available to the reviewers. For example, do not omit or redact important citation information to preserve anonymity. Instead, use third person or named reference to this work, as described above (“Smith showed” rather than “we showed”).



Papers may be accompanied by a resource (software and/or data) described in the paper, but these resources should be anonymized as well. 





Authorship



The author list for submissions should include all (and only) individuals who made substantial contributions to the work presented. Each author listed on a submission to ACL 2020 will be notified of submissions, revisions and the final decision. No changes to the order or composition of authorship may be made to submissions to ACL 2020 after the paper submission deadline.





Citation and Comparison



You are expected to cite all refereed publications relevant to your submission, but you may be excused for not knowing about all unpublished work (especially work that has been recently posted and/or is not widely cited).



In cases where a preprint has been superseded by a refereed publication, the refereed publication should be cited instead of the preprint version.



Papers (whether refereed or not) appearing less than 3 months before the submission deadline are considered contemporaneous to your submission, and you are therefore not obliged to make detailed comparisons that require additional experimentation and/or in-depth analysis.



For more information, see the ACL Policies for Submission, Review, and Citation: https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/new-policies-submission-review-and-citation





Multiple Submission Policy



Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time in the START submission form, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted by ACL 2020. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at ACL 2020 must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper will be presented. We will not accept for publication or presentation the papers that overlap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere.



Authors submitting more than one paper to ACL 2020 must ensure that submissions do not overlap significantly ()25%) with each other in content or results.





Paper Submission and Templates



Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system.  The submission site is now available at https://www.softconf.com/acl2020/papers/



Both long and short papers must follow the ACL Author Guidelines:

https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Author_Guidelines



Style sheets (Latex, Word) are available here.

http://acl2020.org/downloads/acl2020-templates.zip  



The Overleaf template is also available here. https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acl-2020-proceedings-template/zsrkcwjptpcd



Please do not modify these style files, or use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.





Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data



Each ACL 2020 submission can be accompanied by a single PDF appendix, one .tgz or .zip archive containing software, and one .tgz or .zip archive containing data. ACL 2020 encourages the submission of these supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results, and to enable authors to provide additional information that does not fit in the paper. For example, preprocessing decisions, model parameters, feature templates, lengthy proofs or derivations, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of the work described in the paper can be put into the appendix. However, the paper submissions need to remain fully self-contained, as these supplementary materials are completely optional, and reviewers are not even asked to review or download them. If the pseudo-code or derivations or model specifications are an important part of the contribution, or if they are important for the reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work, they should be a part of the main paper, and not appear in the appendix. Supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.

SUBMISSIONS



Long Papers



Long ACL 2017 submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Review forms will be made available prior to the deadlines.



Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited references; final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.



Long papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and which as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings between long papers presented orally and as posters.



Short Papers



ACL 2017 also solicits short papers. Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages. Some kinds of short papers are:



A small, focused contribution

Work in progress

A negative result

An opinion piece

An interesting application nugget



Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given five (5) content pages in the proceedings. Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address reviewers comments in their final versions.



Short papers will be presented in one or more oral or poster sessions. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers presented orally and as posters.



GENERAL NOTES



Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents that are not available to the reviewers. Papers may be accompanied by a resource (software and/or data) described in the paper. Papers that are submitted with accompanying software/data may receive additional credit toward the overall evaluation score, and the potential impact of the software and data will be taken into account when making the acceptance/rejection decisions.



ACL 2017 also encourages the submission of supplementary material to report preprocessing decisions, model parameters, and other details necessary for the replication of the experiments reported in the paper. Seemingly small preprocessing decisions can sometimes make a large difference in performance, so it is crucial to record such decisions to precisely characterize state-of-the-art methods.



Nonetheless, supplementary material should be supplementary (rather than central) to the paper. It may include explanations or details of proofs or derivations that do not fit into the paper, lists of features or feature templates, sample inputs and outputs for a system, pseudo-code or source code, and data. The paper should not rely on the supplementary material: while the paper may refer to and cite the supplementary material and the supplementary material will be available to reviewers, they will not be asked to review or even download the supplementary material. Authors should refer to the contents of the supplementary material in the paper submission, so that reviewers interested in these supplementary details will know where to look.



As the reviewing will be blind, papers must not include authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., ""We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."" must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ""Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."" Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.



Electronic Submission



Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system at



https://www.softconf.com/acl2017/papers  for long papers



https://www.softconf.com/acl2017/shortpapers  for short papers.



Long paper submissions must follow the two-column format of ACL 2017 proceedings without exceeding eight (8) pages of content. References do not count against this limit. Short paper submissions must also follow the two-column format of ACL 2017 proceedings, and must not exceed four (4) pages.  We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files tailored for this year's conference. Submissions must conform to the official style guidelines, which are contained in the style files, and they must be in PDF.



Style files (updated for ACL 2017) and other information about paper formatting requirements are available on the conference website, http://acl2017.org 



Multiple Submission Policy



Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time in an author-blinded cover page, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted by ACL 2017 (see instructions on the submission page). Authors of papers accepted for presentation at ACL 2017  must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper will be presented. We will not accept for publication or presentation papers that overlap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere.



Preprint servers such as arXiv.org and workshops that do not have published proceedings are not considered archival for purposes of submission. Authors must state in the online submission form the name of the workshop or preprint server and title of the non-archival version. The version submitted for review should be suitably anonymized and not contain references to the prior non-archival version. Reviewers will be told: ""The author(s) have notified us that there exists a non-archival previous version of this paper with significantly overlapping text. We have approved submission under these circumstances, but to preserve the spirit of blind review, the current submission does not reference the non-archival version."" Reviewers are free to do what they like with this information.



Authors submitting more than one paper to ACL 2017 must ensure that submissions do not overlap significantly ()25%) with each other in content or results.



Presentation Requirement



All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for ACL 2017 by the early registration deadline.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This workshop is intended as a discussion platform on the status and the future of the evaluation of Natural Language Generation systems. Among other topics, we will discuss current evaluation quality, human versus automated metrics, and the development of shared tasks for NLG evaluation. The workshop also involves an ‘unshared task’, where participants are invited to experiment with evaluation data from earlier shared tasks.



Important dates:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Submissions due - October 15, 2020

Notification of acceptance - November 15, 2020

Camera ready papers due - November 29, 2020

Workshop: December 18, 2020



Papers:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

We encourage a range of papers ranging from commentary and meta-evaluation of existing evaluation strategies to the suggestion of new metrics. We specifically place emphasis on the methodology and linguistic aspects of evaluation. We invite papers on any topic related to the evaluation of NLG systems, including (but not limited to):

Qualitative studies, definitions of evaluation metrics (e.g., readability, fluency, semantic correctness)

Crowdsourcing Strategies, qualitative tests for crowdsourcing (How to elucidate evaluation metrics?)

Looking at individual differences and cognitive biases in human evaluation (expert vs. non-expert, L1 vs L2 speakers)

Best practices for system evaluations (How does your lab choose models?)

Qualitative study/error analysis approaches

Demo: Systems that make the evaluation easier

Comparison of metrics across different NLG tasks (captioning, data2text, story generation, summarization…) or different languages (with a focus on low-resource languages)

Evaluation surveys

Position papers and commentary on trends in evaluation



We encourage the submission of “task proposals”, where authors can propose shared tasks for next year’s edition of the workshop.



Unshared Task:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This year’s edition also features an unshared task: rather than working towards a specific goal, we encourage participants to use a specific collection of datasets, for any evaluation-related goal. For example: comparing a new evaluation method with existing ratings, or carrying out a subset analysis. This allows us to put the results from previous shared tasks in perspective, and helps us develop better evaluation metrics for future shared tasks. Working on the same datasets allows for more focused discussions at the workshop.



Datasets for this year’s edition are existing datasets with system outputs and human ratings. Participants may use any of these for their unshared task submission:

E2E NLG Challenge (http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/InteractionLab/E2E/)

WebNLG Challenge 2017 (https://webnlg-challenge.loria.fr/challenge_2017/)

Surface Realization Shared Task (SRST) 2019 (http://taln.upf.edu/pages/msr2019-ws/SRST.html)



Submission Formats:

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Archival papers (up to 8 pages excluding references; shorter submissions are also welcome)

Non-archival abstract of papers within the topic accepted somewhere else or under submission at the main INLG 2020 (1-2 pages)

Demo papers (1-2 pages)

In recent times, there has been an astronomical surge in demand for data scientists with Harvard Business Review naming Data Scientist as “The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century”.

The workshop will aim to foster collaboration among Data Science academics and practitioners focusing on text data. We have reached a point in Data Science where there is an increasing demand to integrate information from text data into models. This workshop calls for recent advances made both in the area of theoretical Text Processing dealing with lower level algorithms as well applications in Text Mining. The workshop aims to foster collaboration between academic researchers and practitioners so that the two groups could be able to integrate new advances in approaches into real world innovations being worked on by the practitioners.



TOPICS OF INTEREST



Papers are solicited from the following list of topics, however papers dealing with any aspect of Natural Language Processing, Text Processing and Text Mining are welcome.



- Topic detection/Modelling

- Sentiment detection

****** Description ******



With the rapid growing of social networks and Web 2.0 services (e.g. Facebook and Twitter), being able to process data come from such platforms has gained much attention in recent years. SocialNLP is a new inter-disciplinary area of natural language processing (NLP) and social computing. We consider three plausible directions of SocialNLP: (1) addressing issues in social computing using NLP techniques; (2) solving NLP problems using information from social networks or social media; and (3) handling new problems related to both social computing and natural language processing.



Several challenges are foreseeable in SocialNLP. First, the message lengths on social media services are usually short (e.g. 140 characters per tweet in Twitter) and thus it is difficult to apply traditional NLP approaches directly. Second, social media contains heterogeneous information (e.g. tags, friends, fol-lowers, likes, and retweets) that should be considered together with the contents for better quality of analysis. Finally, microblog and the social media content always involve multiple persons with slangs and jargons, and usually require special techniques to process.



To encourage research in the area of SocialNLP, we have organized a SocialNLP SIG-group in AFNLP since 2012 (website: https://sites.google.com/site/socialnlp/home ) and made it a yearly based work-shop series. You can find the contents of the SocialNLP workshops of previous two years in the website. Through this workshop, we anticipate to provide a platform for research outcome presentation and head-to-head discussion in the area of SocialNLP, with the hope to combine the insight and experience of prominent researchers from both NLP and social computing fields to jointly contribute to the area of SocialNLP.





****** About SocialNLP 2017 ******



We aim at organizing the fifth SocialNLP workshop in IEEE BigData 2017 because of the following rationales. First, social media analysis with textual data is closely related to the technical development and application of big data analysis, data mining and machine learning. The most important of all, the processing of unstructured data is vital for big data analysis. Second, user-generated social data in online social services have been accumulated up to a large volume. Processing such social big data with linguistic knowledge and NLP techniques has encountered many important research problems. Third, user-generated data in social media is mainly in the form of texts. Theories and techniques on natural language processing and data mining are desired for semantic understanding, accurate search, and efficient processing of social data content. From the perspective of application, novel online applications involving NLP-based social media analysis, such as emergency management, social recommendation, user behavior analysis, user social community analysis and future prediction are topics that IEEE BigData researchers have paid attention to. In short, hosting SocialNLP workshop in IEEE BigData will provide mutually-reinforced benefits for researchers in areas of big data analysis, natural language processing and social media analytics. We believe collecting thoughts and comments of these researchers will also bring up many great ideas and opportunities for future research collaborations.



The most exciting thing is that we start to call for data paper this year to reach our aim of making data available to the research community by sharing datasets. Through the publication of data papers, SocialNLP participants can get familiar with the data by consulting the data creators in the workshop. We sincerely invite you to join us in this exciting event as well as share your experience, thoughts and comments on natural language processing for social media in your preferred time and venue!

BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION

Sentiment analysis is an important natural language processing (NLP) task in its own right and as part of text processing systems. It is widely used to process and understand Internet texts, which is important for both the scientific community and the business world. Its scientific importance is based on many open challenges to define and precisely capture implicit and explicit sentiment. While most works approach it as a simple categorization problem, sentiment analysis is actually a complex research problem that requires many other NLP tasks, including subjectivity detection, anaphora resolution, word sense disambiguation, sarcasm detection, and aspect extraction. Its practical importance is due to the remarkable benefits to be had from some proven commercial applications, including but not limited to user profiling, digital marketing, and financial prediction.



Sentiment analysis has advanced with progress in the construction of knowledge bases for the identification of polarity in text, e.g., SentiWordNet, SentiStrength, and SenticNet, as well as progress in statistics-based approaches that leverage sentiment expression data sets, i.e., machine learning and deep learning. Despite the expanding size of knowledge bases and data sets, and the complicating algorithms, there is a declining trend in linking sentiment analysis with theories from other disciplines. This, from a scientific perspective means considering contributions from linguistics, psychology, and cognitive science, and from a practical perspective means producing task-aware results for downstream applications.



As an area artificial intelligence (AI), sentiment analysis faces similar challenges in requiring broad interdisciplinary input, explainability, etc. Therefore, the research should not only “go deep”, but also “go broad”. We envision that introducing new theories would also mitigate the interpretability problem, i.e., the problem that sentiment analysis methods become data-dependent and function in a black-box manner. Having many aspects of the same problem may help stepping forward in the path from NLP to natural language understanding. Another way to “go broad” would be the combination with other applications, e.g., social computing and recommender systems, where sentiment analysis may yield unexpected results or new insights.



This special issue focuses on bringing multidisciplinary knowledge into sentiment analysis. We expect submissions that introduce theories not usually part of the standard sentiment analysis framework, and potentially attract researchers to learn more about the relevant literature. Minor improvements, e.g., a new neural network architecture that changes performance but lacks a rationale, and applications of the same method on a different domain or dataset fall outside the scope of this special issue.



TOPICS OF INTEREST

This special issue focuses on emerging techniques and trendy applications of sentiment analysis as a multidisciplinary research area. Given the focus of the journal, we expect to receive works that propose new AI algorithms for the advancement of sentiment analysis research. While other disciplines, e.g., semiotics, psychology, linguistics, are surely welcome, the AI component must be there and it must be in line with the state of the art. Mostly, we expect to receive works on textual sentiment analysis, but papers on multimodal sentiment analysis will also be considered. The topics of this special issue include but are not limited to:

- Critical assessments of existing sentiment analysis methods

- Explainable sentiment predictions

- Sentiment of multiword expressions

- Hybrid symbolic and sub-symbolic AI for sentiment analysis

- Theoretical foundations of AI for sentiment analysis

- SenticNet 6 and other hybrid knowledge bases for sentiment analysis

- Sentic LSTM and other hybrid deep nets for sentiment analysis

- Commonsense reasoning for sentiment analysis

- Semantic models for sentiment analysis

- Phrase structure grammar for sentiment analysis

- Conversational sentiment analysis

- Morphological hints for sentiment analysis

- Joint sentiment analysis and sarcasm/irony detection

- Sentiment analysis applications

- Sentiment analysis and language learning theory

- Sentiment analysis and social network analysis

- Sentiment analysis and stress/suicide detection

- Sentiment analysis and forecasting methods

BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION

The AI gold rush has become increasingly intense for the huge potential AI offers for human development and growth. Most of what is considered AI today is actually subsymbolic AI, i.e., machine learning: an extremely powerful tool for exploring large amounts of data and, for instance, making predictions, suggestions, and categorizations based on them. All such classifications are made by transforming real items that need to be classified into numbers or features in order to later calculate distances between them. While this is good for making comparison between such items and cluster them accordingly, it does not tell us much about the items themselves.



Thanks to machine learning, we may find out that apples are similar to oranges but this information is only useful to cluster oranges and apples together: it does not actually tell us what an apple is, what it is usually used for, where it is usually found, how does it taste, etc. Throughout the span of our lives, we learn a lot of things by example but many others are learnt via our own personal (kinaesthetic) experience of the world and taught to us by our parents, mentors, and friends. If we want to replicate human intelligence into a machine, we cannot avoid implementing this kind of top-down learning, also known as commonsense knowledge representation & reasoning (CKRR).



As mentioned by Oren Etzioni, commonsense is the dark matter of AI: it is a little bit ineffable, but you see its effects on everything. Commonsense is a kind of knowledge that sounds obvious and natural to us but it is actually daedal and multifaceted: the illusion of simplicity comes from the fact that, as each new group of skills matures, we build more layers on top of them and tend to forget about the previous layers. Today computers lack this kind of knowledge. They do only what they are programmed to do: they only have one way to deal with a problem and, if something goes wrong, they get stuck.



In this sense, CKRR is key for the future of AI research. Emerging embedding-based methods for CKRR have shown their ability to capture relational facts and model different scenarios with heterogenous information. By combining symbolic reasoning methods or Bayesian models, deep representation learning techniques on knowledge graphs attempt to handle complex reasoning with relational path and symbolic logic. CKRR can be one of the paths towards the emulation of high-level cognition and human-level intelligence. CKRR can also be seen as a means to tackle the problem of explainability in AI.



This special issue focuses on emerging techniques and trendy applications of AI for CKRR in fields such as natural language processing, computer vision, bioinformatics, and more. Mostly, we expect to receive papers on deep representation learning techniques for CKRR. Old-school, purely symbolic approaches to CKRR will be desk-rejected. However, we do welcome hybrid (symbolic and subsymbolic) approaches to CKRR.



TOPICS OF INTEREST

Works on the creation, use, and evaluation of CKRR resources, e.g., knowledge graphs, ontologies, are also welcome. These could be in English as well as in other languages. Mostly, we expect to receive works on textual CKRR, but papers on multimodal CKRR will also be considered. The topics of this special issue include but are not limited to:

- Deep representation learning for CKRR

- Hybrid (symbolic and subsymbolic) CKRR

- Creation, use, and evaluation of CKRR resources

Workshop on the Semantic Analysis of Documents (SemADoc 2014)

-------------------------------------------------------------



https://sites.google.com/site/semadoc2014/



Hosted by the ACM Symposium on Document Engineering

September 16-19, Fort Collins, near Denver, Colorado, USA



Scope and topics:



A large number of document management problems would benefit from

having the semantics of documents explicitly represented. However,

manually assigning semantic descriptions to documents is labour

intensive and error prone. At the same time, the manual generation

of domain specific taxonomies is not only labour intensive, but it

also needs to be repeated often as the domains themselves and

their key concepts shift with time.



In this workshop we will focus on document content analysis and

semantic enrichment to generate a layer of semantic description of

documents that is useful for document management tasks, such as

semantic information retrieval, conceptual organization and

clustering of document collections for sense making, semantic

expert profiling, and document recommender systems.



The workshop is timely and relevant to the Document Engineering

community, as its focus is on semantically enriching documents and

document collections, to make them more accessible to their

readers. The task is nontrivial due to the volume of text data and

the rate at which text data is accumulated by companies,

government, and individuals.



We invite submissions in all areas of semantic analysis and

enrichment of documents, such as:

- automatic tagging of documents

- named entity disambiguation

- semantic linking of documents

- interactive classification and clustering of documents

- document summarization

- curation and validation of the analysis process, generation of visualizations of documents

- author and document collection semantics

- user engagement in the semantic analysis process via suitable annotation and correction tools

- study of the trade off between accuracy of the results and user effort



Submissions aimed at solving practical problems in specific

application domains are especially welcome, including but not

limited to:

- digital libraries

- legal document management

- personalized online learning systems

- news media



We encourage submissions of work in progress, concept papers, and

generally material that will stimulate discussion, generate useful

feedback to the authors, promote research collaborations and

vigorous exchange of ideas on promising research directions.

Constanța, Romania



A satellite event of EUROLAN-2017

Summer School on Biomedical Text Processing

http://eurolan.info.uaic.ro/2017/index.html



Description 

In an era when massive amounts of medical data became available, researchers working in biological, biomedical and clinical domains have increasingly started to require the help of language engineers to process large quantities of biomedical and molecular biology literature (such as PubMed), patient data or health records. Linking the contents of these documents to each other, as well as to specialized ontologies, could enable access to and discovery of structured clinical information and foster a major leap in natural language processing and health research.



MEDA-2017 aims to gather innovative approaches for the exploitation of biomedical data. The workshop will bring together practitioners, researchers, and scholars to share examples, use cases, theories and analysis of biomedical data.



MEDA-2017 Workshop is part of EUROLAN-2017 Summer School (the 13th in the series of EUROLAN schools), which will provide a comprehensive overview of Biomedical Text Processing. We encourage students and young researchers, willing to present their work in MEDA-2017, and whose subject of interest departure from pure textual biomedical data, to attend the School’s tutorials, where they could find surprising information that could fit their own research. Often, solutions to our problems come from unexpected fields. The larger the scientific culture – the bigger the chance for an innovative solution. 



Topics

We invite submissions, which may include, but are not restricted, to the following topics:

• mining biomedical literature

• event-based text mining for biology and related fields

• event extraction in medical texts

• entity identification and normalization

• conceptual graphs extracted from medical texts

• annotation of semantic content, with applications in medicine and biology

• textual big data techniques

• medical search engines

• health information technologies meet language technologies

• deep learning for bioinformatics

• biomedical question/answering 

• Clinical data repositories / Big Data and Cloud Computing

• clinical relationships

• medical topic modeling

• medical language systems

• clinical text analysis

• text summarization in the biomedical domain



Submission

As one of the main goals of MEDA-2017 Workshop is to polish the students’ and young researchers’ abilities as future specialists in Biomedical Data, through feedback received from competent scientists, we accept and even encourage presentation of work in progress.

The paper should briefly and clearly state:

• the problem that the proposed research is addressing;

• the main contribution(s) of the research to the BioData or BioNLP field, differences and departures from the state of the art;

• the methodology of research, proposed solution(s), results, (open) linguistic resources and/or software offered to the scientific community and comparisons;

• future research plan.



We invite both long (8 pages) and short (4 pages) papers, representing original research, innovative approaches and resource types, use cases or in-depth discussions. Short papers may also represent project proposals or work in progress.

Submissions must be electronic, in .pdf format and (if applicable) as databases and/or open software. Papers should adopt the Springer LNCS format (see http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html). Papers submitted to other conferences or journals must state this fact. If a paper has appeared already at the time of the Workshop in another conference or journal, it must be withdrawn from MEDA-2017.

Until recently this area has been performed by experts in computer science or experts in artificial intelligence. In fact, there were many computer applications in Computational Intelligence without any theoretical support. Today, people working in such areas often work as members of pluridisciplinary and interdisciplinary teams, including, of course, computer scientists and expert of artificial intelligence but also mathematicians, statisticians, linguists, language experts, philosophers, logicians, cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, psycholinguists, anthropologists, etc. Therefore, Computational Intelligence must become more connected to areas as cognitive science, mathematics, statistic, linguistics, philosophy, logics, neuroscience, etc. through the development of methods, strategies and algorithms for all aspects of language processing, discourse processing, knowledge processing, information processing, etc. These methods and strategies can be seen according to their theoretical or practical significance.



The aim of this track is to present original works related to computational intelligence. These works should focus either on practical applications, or on results of theoretical foundations of the discipline. We, therefore, invite authors for original papers submissions for any work related to theoretical or practical aspects of Computational Intelligence.



Topics of interest may include, but are in no way limited, to: 



1. Philosophy of language and discourse, 

2. Cognitive science, 

3. Non standard logics, 

4. Natural language processing, 

5. Computational linguistics (lexicology; morphology; syntax; semantics). 

6. Information extraction. 

7. Ontologies. 

8. Knowledge processing. 

9. Data Mining, Text Mining, Web Mining.

10. Information retrieval.

11. Web Semantics. 

Etc.

First call for papers



We would like to cordially invite you to consider contributing a paper to FETLT16. This workshop has been conceived as a meeting point where experts and professionals in the fields of language technologies and other converging areas can discuss the state of the art, as well as the emerging trends in the sector.



Language technologies have become a prominent area of research, development and innovation. New trends and proposals in this field will have an impressive social impact in the near future. Therefore, the workshop will welcome contributions describing results and ongoing projects exploring new tendencies, techniques and approaches. Among them, we would like to place a special emphasis on the convergence between Language Technologies, Machine Learning and Big Data.

Scope



The Workshop ""Future and Emerging Trends in Language Technology"" has been conceived as a meeting point where experts and professionals in the fields of language technologies and other converging areas will discuss the state of the art, as well as the emerging trends in the sector. The main objective of this workshop is to serve as a bridge between academia and industry, as well as representatives of agencies that coordinate research and innovation policies. The workshop thus guarantees a multidisciplinary common spirit in which experts will be able to present and analyze the trends that will shape the immediate future as well as the mid-term vision in this sector.



Following this approach, the organizing committee of the workshop welcomes the reception of papers under the following categories:

New Applications of Key Consolidated Approaches



Authors can submit their paper on new strategies, models and consolidated techniques at the academic or industrial levels that are being used right now to tackle any issue in the field of Language Technology, as well as in the interconnection of this field with Machine Learning and Big Data. Papers under this category must provide a brief explanation of the foundations of the approaches proposed and the areas and applications for which those techniques are useful in the present.

Emerging Research



Authors can submit their paper under this category when they have preliminary results obtained from ongoing research projects. Papers must describe the motivation of the approach, as well as the scientific, methodological and/or technological approach chosen. Papers must also analyze the advantages and benefits derived from such approaches for a broad application in the field of Language Technology, and the rest of convergent areas related to it.

Challenge Papers



Authors can submit a paper on different fields and convergent areas related to Language Technology describing the occurrence of new and constant challenges for both the academic and the industrial areas. These papers must indicate which areas and specific problems are currently posing a concrete technological and/or methodological challenge. Papers under this category must include the reasons why present-day techniques should be considered insuficient to tackle the issues at hand by the presentation of preliminary research/development results as a justification. Additionally, articles in this section should propose research strategies that can be considered promising to provide sound solutions to the problems defined, with a solid and clear scientific and technical argumentation.

In conjunction with EACL 2017, Valencia, Spain



Sponsored by SIGSLAV: Special Interest Group on Slavic Natural Language Processing of the ACL





DATES



Submission deadline: 16 January 2017



Notification of acceptance: 11 February 2017



Camera-ready papers due: 21 February 2017



Workshop: 3 or 4 April 2017





THEME and MOTIVATION



Languages from the Balto-Slavic group play an important role due to their diverse cultural heritage and widespread use -- with over 400 million speakers worldwide. The recent political and economic developments in Central and Eastern Europe have brought Balto-Slavic societies and their languages into focus in terms of rapid technological advancement and rapidly expanding consumer markets.



This Workshop addresses Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the Balto-Slavic languages. The NLP tasks in urgent need of attention include, but are not limited to:



- morphological analysis and generation,



- morphosyntactic tagging,



- syntactic and semantic parsing,



- lexical semantics,



- named-entity recognition,



- text normalisation and processing non-standard language



- coreference resolution,



- information extraction,



- question answering,



- information retrieval,



- text summarization,



- machine translation,



- development of linguistic resources.



Research on theoretical and applied topics in the context of some of the Balto-Slavic languages is still in its early stages. The linguistic phenomena specific to Balto-Slavic languages -- such as rich morphological inflection and free word order -- make the construction of NLP tools for these languages a challenging and intriguing task.



The goal of this Workshop is to bring together researchers from academia and industry working on NLP for Balto-Slavic languages. In particular, the Workshop will serve to stimulate the research on NLP techniques for Balto-Slavic languages, and to foster the creation of tools and resources for these languages. The Workshop will provide a forum for exchanging ideas and experience, discussing difficult-to-tackle problems, and making the resources that are available more widely-known. One fascinating aspect of this sub-family of languages is the striking structural similarity, as well as an easily recognizable core vocabulary and inflectional inventory spanning the entire group of languages -- despite a lack of mutual intelligibility -- which creates a special environment in which researchers can fully appreciate the shared problems and solutions and communicate naturally.



SUBMISSION:



There will be two types of submissions: long papers and short papers.



Long papers should describe original, unpublished and completed work. Short papers should describe: (a) work in progress and/or small focused contributions, or (b) system demonstrations, new linguistic resources and experience of using existing software and resources, or (c) ongoing projects and activities that are relevant to all stakeholders in the domain of Balto-Slavic NLP.



Overlap with previously published work should be clearly mentioned. The authors should indicate along with their submission if the paper has been submitted elsewhere. In case the paper is rejected by the main conference, it should be indicated in the submission.



All submissions will be judged on correctness, novelty, technical strength, clarity of presentation, usability, and significance/relevance to the Workshop. Submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee.



The reviewing of long papers will be blind. Therefore, long papers should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Self-citations and other references that reveal the authors' identity must be avoided.



In particular, submissions describing systems, resources, or solutions that are made available to the wider public would be strongly encouraged, as this would help to promote computational linguistics applications for Balto-Slavic languages.



Long paper submissions should follow the two-column format of EACL 2017 proceedings not exceeding eight (8) pages of content plus two (2) additional pages for references. Short paper submissions should follow the same format, and should not exceed four (4) pages for content plus two (2) additional pages for references. Submissions must conform to the official style guidelines of EACL 2017, which are contained in the style files (http://eacl2017.org/images/site/eacl-2017-template.zip), and must be in PDF.



Camera-ready versions of accepted papers must be provided both in LaTeX and PDF format.



SHARED TASK



For the first time at BSNLP, we are organi sing a shared task on multilingual named entity recognition aims at recognizing mentions of named entities in web documents 

in Slavic languages, their normalization / lemmatization, and cross-language matching. Further details can be found at:

in conjunction with



The Sixth International Conference on Social Networks Analysis, Management and Security(SNAMS-2019)



Granada, Spain. October 22-25, 2019

	                



 



    The workshop aims at demonstrating recent Advances in Natural Language Processing (ANLP) by bringing together leading academicians, scientists, researchers and practitioners to discuss their findings in NLP. This area of research has been constantly gaining momentum and attention over the past few years as textual material become available in abundance (social networks and web content) and advanced computational power become accessible. This resulted in an interesting array of practical applications. This is evident in the number of conferences, conference tracks, workshops, special issues of journals dedicated to or issues related to ANLP. Another indication of this growing interest is the surge of papers, books, and other forms of publications related to NLP. Noticeably, deep learning is dominating NLP as it did to other areas of artificial intelligence. Deep learning is the modern application of earlier neural network technology but with multiple layers that made possible with modern computing technology. The application of deep learning technology to NLP is progressing at a fast pace, and it is anticipated that we will see many exciting new discoveries here in the next few years. Therefore, the objective of this workshop is to present current and future advances in NLP. Authors are encouraged to submit their original work, which is not submitted elsewhere, to this workshop.



    Proceedings of the workshops will be published by the IEEE Conference Publishing Services (CPS) and will be submitted for inclusion in the IEEE-Xplore and the IEEE Computer Society (CSDL) digital libraries.

=== Scope and Aim of the Workshop ===



The open access movement in scientific publishing and search engines like Google Scholar have made scientific articles more broadly accessible. During the last decade, the availability of scientific papers in full text has become more and more widespread thanks to the growing number of publications on online platforms such as ArXiv and CiteSeer. The efforts to provide articles in machine-readable formats and the rise of Open Access publishing have resulted in a number of standardized formats for scientific papers (such as NLM-JATS, TEI, DocBook), full-text datasets for research experiments (PubMed, JSTOR, etc.) and corpora (iSearch, etc.). At the same time, research in the field of Natural Language Processing have provided a number of open source tools for versatile text processing (e.g. NLTK, Mallet, OpenNLP, CoreNLP, Gate, CiteSpace).



Scientific papers are highly structured texts and display specific properties related to their references but also argumentative and rhetorical structure. Recent research in this field has concentrated on the construction of ontologies for citations and scientific articles (e.g. CiTO, LinkedScience1) and studies of the distribution of references . However, up to now full-text mining efforts are rarely used to provide data for bibliometric analyses. While bibliometrics traditionally relies on the analysis of metadata of scientific papers (see e.g. a recent special issue on Combining Bibliometrics and Information Retrieval, Mayr & Scharnhorst, 2015), we will explore the ways full-text processing of scientific papers and linguistic analyses can play. With this workshop we like to discuss novel approaches and provide insights into scientific writing that can bring new perspectives to understand both the nature of citations and the nature of scientific articles. The possibility to enrich metadata by the full-text processing of papers offers new fields of application to bibliometrics studies.



Working with full text allows us to go beyond metadata used in bibliometrics. Full text offers a new field of investigation, where the major problems arise around the organization and structure of text, the extraction of information and its representation on the level of metadata. Furthermore, the study of contexts around in-text citations offers new perspectives related to the semantic dimension of citations. The analyses of citation contexts and the semantic categorization of publications will allow us to rethink co-citation networks, bibliographic coupling and other bibliometric techniques.



The workshop aims to bring together researchers in bibliometrics and computational linguistics in order to study the ways bibliometrics can benefit from large-scale text analytics and sense mining of scientific papers, thus exploring the interdisciplinarity of Bibliometrics and Natural Language Processing. How can we enhance author network analysis and bibliometrics using data obtained by text analytics? What insights can NLP provide on the structure of scientific writing, on citation networks, and on in-text citation analysis?







=== Goals of the workshop ===



The workshop aims to bring together researchers in bibliometrics and computational linguistics in order to study the ways bibliometrics can benefit from large-scale text analytics and sense mining of scientific papers, thus exploring the interdisciplinarity of Bibliometrics and Natural Language Processing.



The first edition of this workshop, co-located with ISSI 2015, attracted more than 70 participants and six full paper contributions, showing a large interest in these topics in the community. The goal of this second edition of the workshop is to continue to encourage the collaboration between these two domains and to answer questions like: How can we enhance author network analysis and Bibliometrics using data obtained by text analytics? What insights can NLP provide on the structure of scientific writing, on citation networks, and on in-text citation analysis?

FIRST INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP IN MULTIMEDIA PRAGMATICS

Co-Located with the IEEE FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MULTIMEDIA INFORMATION PROCESSING AND RETRIEVAL (MIPR’18)



April 10-12, 2018 • Miami, Florida



Most multimedia objects are spatio-temporal simulacrums of the real world. This supports our view that the next grand challenge for our community will be understanding and formally modeling the flow of life around us, over many modalities and scales. As technology advances, the nature of these simulacrums will evolve as well, becoming more detailed and revealing to us more information concerning the nature of reality.



Currently, IoT is the state-of-the-art organizational approach to construct complex representations of the flow of life around us. Various, perhaps pervasive, sensors, working collectively, will broadcast to us representations of real events in real time. It will be our task to continuously extract the semantics of these representations and possibly react to them by injecting some response actions into the mix to ensure some desired outcome.



Our community has successfully developed various approaches to decode the syntax and semantics of these artifacts. The development of techniques that use contextual information is in its infancy, however. With the expansion of the data horizon, through the ever-increasing use of metadata, we can certainly put all media on more equal footing.



The NLP community has its own set of approaches in semantics and pragmatics. Natural language is certainly an excellent exemplar of multimedia, and the use of audio and text features has played a part in the development of our field.



However, if we are to develop more unified approaches to modeling the flow of life around us, both of our communities can certainly benefit by examining in detail what the other can offer. Now is the perfect time to actively promote this cross-fertilization of our ideas to solve some very hard and important problems.



Authors are invited to submit regular papers (6 pages), short papers (4 pages), and demo papers (2 pages) at the workshop website mipr.sigappfr.org. Guidelines can also be found there.



Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

• Affective computing

• Computational semiotics

• Cross-cultural multi-modal recognition techniques

• Distributional semantics

• Event modeling, recognition, and understanding

• Gesture recognition

• Human-machine multimodal interaction

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

----------------------------------------------



Submissions to *SEM-2018 must describe unpublished work and be written in English. We solicit both long and short papers.



Long papers describe original research and may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus at most two extra pages for references. Final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account. Long papers will be presented orally.



Short papers describe original focused research, project or system description, and may consist of up to four (4) pages, plus one extra page for references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given five (5) content pages in the proceedings. Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address reviewers comments in their final versions. Short papers will be presented as posters.



Each submission will be reviewed by at least three reviewers. Final versions should take into account the comments from the reviewers.



As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., ""We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."" must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ""Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."". As for online paper sharing, at *SEM, we adopt the ACL policy for submission, which can be found here: https://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Policies_for_Submission,_Review_and_Citation. Papers that do not conform to requirements will be rejected without review. For a paper to be included in the conference proceedings, at least one of the authors must be registered as a participant at the *SEM conference.



Papers will be submitted using the START system: http://www.softconf.com/naacl2018/starsem18/

1st Conference on Automated Knowledge Base Construction (AKBC)

May 20-22, 2019, Monday-Wednesday, Amherst, MA

www: http://www.akbc.ws ; email: info@akbc.ws



Key dates

-------------

November 16, 2018, Friday: Conference paper submissions due

January 11, Friday: Workshop topics announced

Knowledge Base Construction

-------------

Knowledge gathering, representation, and reasoning are among the fundamental challenges of artificial intelligence.  Large-scale repositories of knowledge about entities, relations, and their abstractions are known as “knowledge bases”.  Most major technology companies now have substantial efforts in knowledge base construction, and related scholarly work spans many research areas, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, information integration, databases, search, data mining, knowledge representation, human computation, human-computer interfaces, and fairness.  The AKBC conference serves as a research forum for all these areas, in both academia and industry.



New Conference

-------------

Nearly ten years after the first AKBC workshop in Grenoble, France, AKBC is becoming a conference.  Why a new stand-alone conference?

- Long-standing and growing interest in the area, now with too much material for a one-day workshop.  We have sufficient material for a two-day conference plus topical workshops.

- We want to grow and connect the community beyond existing individual conference communities, bringing together ML, NLP, DB, IR, KRR, semantics, reasoning, common sense, QA, human computation, dialog, HCI.

- We want to set our own culture, including reviewing practices, and meeting format. We have fond memories of the first AKBC 2010 in Grenoble: a two-day meeting that included an afternoon hike in the Alps with much great scientific discussion.

- Why now?  Growing interest across many areas.  Disconnect among multiple relevant communities.  Growing industry and government interest.



Call For Papers

-------------

We invite the submission of papers describing previously unpublished research, including new methodology, datasets, evaluations, surveys, reproduced results, negative results, and visionary positions.



Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Natural language processing, information extraction, extraction of entities, relations, and events, semantic parsing, coreference, machine reading, entailment, web mining, multilingual NLP.

- Information integration, entity resolution, schema & ontology alignment, text and structure alignment, federated KBs, Semantic Web.

- Machine learning, supervised, unsupervised, lightly-supervised and distantly-supervised learning, deep learning, symbolic learning, multimodal learning, embeddings of knowledge.

- Search, question-answering, reasoning, knowledge base completion, queries on mixtures of structured and unstructured data; querying under uncertainty.

- Multi-modal knowledge bases: structured data, text, images, video, audio.

Human-computer interaction, crowdsourcing, interactive learning.

- Fairness, accountability, transparency, misinformation, multiple viewpoints, uncertainty.

- Databases, probabilistic databases, distributed databases, database cleaning, scalable computation, distributed computation, dynamic data, online adaptation of knowledge.

Systems, languages and toolkits, demonstrations of existing knowledge bases.

- Evaluation of AKBC, datasets, evaluation methodology.



Authors of accepted papers will have the option for their conference paper to be archival (with full text in AKBC Proceedings, and be considered for best paper awards) or non-archival (listed in AKBC Conference schedule, with full text in OpenReview, and the flexibility to also submit elsewhere).  Double-blind reviewing will be performed on the OpenReview platform, with papers, reviews and comments publicly visible, much like ICLR 2018.



Papers should be submitted in JAIR format (which is single-column), restricted to 15 pages excluding references (the equivalent of about 8 pages double column).  



Submission site: http://www.akbc.ws/2019/submission



Dual Submission Policy: Submissions that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, are not allowed and violate our dual submission policy.  However, papers that cite previous related work by the authors and papers that have appeared on non-peered reviewed websites (like arXiv) or that have been presented at workshops (i.e., venues that do not have publication proceedings) do not violate the policy. The policy is enforced during the whole reviewing process period.

Six decades of failure to pass the Turing test by machines lead us to rethink previous approaches, to lean towards new technologies and knowledge sources, and to combine them with advances in philosophy, linguistics and cognitive science. We stress the fact that the age of information explosion and more powerful learning algorithms gives us a whole new spectrum of possibilities for creating an intelligent machine. Many marvelous ideas of the dawn of Artificial Intelligence research faced problems of exceptions and the impossibility of manual input of all needed knowledge, but today we have vast amounts of data from sensors, images and text so that we can rethink classical AI methods and approaches to dialog systems. The increased use of WWW, Internet of Things or knowledge bases, etc. could allow us to determine standard human behaviors, emotions or even moral reasoning according to the Wisdom of Crowds hypothesis. Collective input data could also help to retrieve knowledge about the physical world we live in. By combining Natural Language Processing methods and/or Machine Learning techniques with cognitive architectures and philosophy of mind, we can discover a new range of intelligent systems that understand us, our environment, and our feelings. In this context, we see a role for NLP/ML and cognitive approaches to play in developing a new generation of user-friendly, more autonomous but still safe systems that, through interaction with the user and the world, can learn how to reason, behave or speak naturally. We are interested in original papers on methods for dialog systems that use common sense knowledge and reasoning, affective computing, cognitive methods, learning from broad sets of data and acquiring knowledge, language itself, user preferences. etc.

The workshop intends to spark an interdisciplinary discussion on joining forces to return AI to its original, broader and deeper goals which are currently represented by AGI – Artificial General Intelligence.

After two successful LaCATODAs associated with Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour (AISB) and International Association for Computing and Philosophy (IACAP) conferences, we plan an 1-day workshop under IJCAI-17 umbrella to take place in Melbourne on (most probably) August 19 or 20, 2017. An invited talk from Dr. Mark Ellison (Australian National University) is planned."

The 3rd Summer Datathon on Linguistic Linked Open Data (SD-LLOD-19) will be held from May 12 to 17, 2019 in Schloss Dagstuhl -- Leibniz Center for Informatics, Wadern, Germany (see http://datathon2019.linguistic-lod.org). SD-LLOD-19 is organized in conjunction with and held before the 2nd Conference on Language, Data and Knowledge (LDK-2019), May 20-22, Leipzig, Germany (http://2019.ldk-conf.org).



The SD-LLOD datathon has the main goal of giving people from industry and academia practical knowledge in the field of Linked Data and its application to natural language data and natural language annotations, from areas as diverse as knowledge engineering, lexicography, the language sciences, natural language processing and computational philology. 



We provide tutorials and supervision by leading experts on Linked Open Data and its application to language resources, human language technology and the language sciences. The final aim is to enable participants to migrate their own linguistic data and publish them as Linked Data on the Web. 



The SD-LLOD datathon is unique in its specialization worldwide and continues a series of international hackathons and summer schools organized since 2012. This edition is supported by several international projects addressing different aspects of natural language processing, lexicography and digital humanities: The Research Group ""Linked Open Dictionaries (LiODi)"", funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Action ""Pret-a-LLOD. Ready-to-use Multilingual Linked Language Data for Knowledge Services across Sectors"" and the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Action ""ELEXIS. European Lexicographic Infrastructure"".



During the datathon, participants will:

* Generate and publish their own Linguistic Linked (Open) Data from some existing data sources or existing tools.

* Apply Linked Data principles and Semantic Web technologies (Ontologies, RDF, Linked Data) to language resources and human language technology.

* Use the principal models for representing Linguistic Linked Open Data, in particular Ontolex-Lemon, Web Annotation and knowledge representation vocabularies such as SKOS and OWL.

* Gather experiences with terminology resources developed for or used in the Linguistic Linked Open Data context, such as lexvo, lexinfo, OLiA and GOLD. 

* Learn about multilingual dataset linking against knowledge bases from the Web of Data, such as DBpedia or BabelNet.

* Learn about benefits and applications of linguistic linked data for specific use cases.



The program of the summer datathon will contain three types of sessions:

* Seminars *to show novel aspects and discuss selected topics.

* Practical sessions* to introduce the basic foundations of each topic, methods, and technologies and where participants will perform different tasks using the methods and technologies presented.

* Hacking sessions,* where participants will follow the whole process of generating and publishing Linguistic Linked Data with some existing data set.



In addition to  participation, attendants are invited to propose a miniproject related to the topic and to bring to the datathon some dataset of linguistic data produced by their organizations  to work with during the hacking sessions and transform into linked data. Participants who cannot provide their own linguistic dataset can join another's miniproject or some of the ones proposed by the organisers. There will be an award to the best miniproject.



Participants should bring their own laptops to follow and participate in the hacking sessions, they will be provided with digital copies of all necessary material used during the course and will have assistance for installing all the required software.

==Submission Guidelines==



The proceedings of the conference will be published as a volume in the Springer LNAI series (EI & ISTP indexed, for English papers), and the ACTA Scientiarum Naturalium Universitatis Pekinensis (EI & Scopus indexed, for Chinese papers), respectively. English submissions should follow the LNCS formatting instructions, without exceeding twelve (12) pages, including references and possible appendices. The submissions must therefore be formatted in accordance with the standard Springer style sheets ([LaTeX][Microsoft Word]). Submissions in Chinese should follow the formatting instructions of the ACTA Scientiarum Naturalium Universitatis Pekinensis [Format Template], without exceeding eight (8) pages in A4 (210 × 297 mm) size.



Manuscripts should be submitted electronically through the submission website. Email submissions will not be accepted. English papers should be submitted to the Main Track (https://www.softconf.com/NLPCC2019/Main-English), and Chinese papers should be submitted to the Chinese Track (https://www.softconf.com/NLPCC2019/Main-Chinese). Authors of Chinese submissions are required to provide Chinese titles in the submission system. All student first authors are encouraged to contact nlpcc@pku.edu.cn, indicating their names, affiliations, and the titles of their submissions, in order to participate the nomination of the best student paper award.



All submissions should be in PDF format. 



==Double-Blind Reviewing==



Anonymity Requirements for Double-Blind Reviewing: Every research paper submitted to NLPCC 2019 will undergo a ""double-blind"" reviewing process: the PC members and referees who review thepaper will not know the identity of the authors. To ensure anonymity of authorship, authors mustprepare their manuscript as follows:



1. Authors' names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.

2. Funding sources must not be acknowledged on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.

3. Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper.

4. The paper's file name must not identify the authors of the paper. It is strongly suggested that the submitted file be named with the assigned submission number.

5. You must also use care when referring to related previous work, particularly your own work,in the paper. For example, if you are Jane Smith, the following text gives away the authorship of the submitted paper:

a. In our previous work [1,2], we presented two algorithms for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ... Bibliography

b. [1] Jane Smith, ""A Simple Algorithm for ...,"" Proceedings of ACL 2007, pp. 1-8.

c. [2] Jane Smith, ""A More Complicated Algorithm for ...,"" Proceedings of ACL 2008, pp.33-40.

The solution is to reference your past work in the third person (just as you would any other piece of work that is related to the submitted paper). This allows you to set the context for thesubmitted paper, while at the same time preserving anonymity:

a. In previous work [1,2], algorithms were presented for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ... Bibliography

b. [1] Jane Smith, ""A Simple Algorithm for ...,"" Proceedings of ACL 2007, pp. 1-8.

c. [2] Jane Smith, ""A More Complicated Algorithm for ...,"" Proceedings of ACL 2008, pp.33-40.



It is the responsibility of authors to do their very best to preserve anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to rejection without review. Submission details are provided on the conference website: http://tcci.ccf.org.cn/conference/2019.



For more information about paper submission, contact program co-chair (nlpcc@pku.edu.cn).



==Events==



In addition to technical contributions, NLPCC 2019 invites proposals for workshops, panels, technical evaluations and industry presentations. For workshops, NLPCC 2019 will provide administrative support for workshop room booking, registration and publication. All papers accepted by NLPCC 2019 workshops will be published in a combined volume of the NLPCC 2019 Proceedings.

Programming language origins in natural language. Different from natural language that is used by humans amongst themselves, programming languages allow humans to tell machines what to do. The meaningful identifier names and natural language documentation allow other developers to understand the author’s intent and then maintain and extend the code. At the same time, the substantial information contained in the code enables the intervention of machine learning algorithms in a variety of software engineering tasks. However, the mining of programming languages could not exactly follow the manner of natural language processing, because of their difference. Programming languages need a high degree of expertise, completeness and precision because computer cannot think outside the statement while natural language may be informal and allow minor errors. The programming language syntax is also not based on natural language grammar. We have witnessed an increasing number of successful machine learning techniques for natural language processing, e.g., GPT (Generative Pre- Training) by Open AI, and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for language understanding. In this deep learning era, what are the challenges and opportunities to deploy such NLP breakthroughs in programming language processing? What is the current more specialised model for programming language processing? How do machine learning and software engineering researchers apply the knowledge in collaboration to further the field and improve intelligence of the code? We propose to invite world-leading experts from both machine learning and software engineering to discuss and debate the path forward for mining the value of programming languages.

Special Track at FLAIRS-33 Conference



DoubleTree Ocean Point Resort & Spa



North Miami Beach, Florida, USA

May 17-20, 2020



Scope of the Track



Spoken language is the favored media of communication between human beings whether face-to-face or through various communication tools such as the phone, voice chat applications or even the general media like the radio or TV. Hence, adding conversational interfaces to various types of computer software and hardware devices will make them more natural. To achieve this goal, there are still multiple challenges at all the levels from speech recognition and synthesis, spoken language understanding and generation as well as dialog management. To meet these challenges, interdisciplinary work at the cross roads between linguistics, AI, Data Science, and Cognitive Science is carried by researchers around the world.



The goal of this track is to be a forum for scholars and scientists to present their empirical research, and well-grounded theory related to Spoken Language Processing as well as to Dialog and Conversational Systems.

Papers and Abstracts



Papers accepted in the track will be published by AAAI as part of the FLAIRS proceedings. There are three kinds of submissions: full paper – a paper of high quality, which will be published in the proceedings (up to 6 pages) and will be presented by the author in a corresponding track (20 minute oral presentation); short paper – a paper that shows some novelty and general interest, but is more preliminary or in the early stages of development, which also get published in the proceedings (up to 4 pages) and the author presents the work in a poster session; and poster abstract, which will be published as abstract only (up to 250 words; please follow this format for the final camera-ready poster abstract) and the author presents the work in a poster session. Rejected full papers may still be accepted as short papers or poster abstracts, if reviewers found interest in the idea, but the paper quality was not sufficient to be published in full length. There will also be a separate abstract only submission for authors who want to submit just an abstract and present it in a poster session.



For each accepted paper (full, short, or poster abstract), there must be an accompanying author registration. A single author may have up to a maximum of two papers per author registration. Author names may be changed or re-ordered after reviewing; however, for budgetary reasons, registration fees will be based on the details at the time of submission and review.

Submission Instructions



Submitted papers must be original, and not submitted concurrently to a journal or another conference. Double-blind reviewing will be provided, so submitted papers must use fake author names and affiliations. Papers must use the latest AAAI Press Word template or LaTeX macro package, and must be submitted as PDF through the EasyChair conference system. (Do NOT use a fake name for your EasyChair login; your EasyChair account information is hidden from reviewers.)



FLAIRS will not accept any paper which, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference. Authors are also required not to submit their papers elsewhere during FLAIRS's review period. These restrictions apply only to journals and conferences, not to workshops and similar specialized presentations with a limited audience and without archival proceedings.

You are invited to participate in the 3rd Joint Workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced IR and NLP for Digital Libraries (BIRNDL), to be held as part of 41st International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2018) in Ann Arbor, Michigan USA on 12th July 2018.



This is the third BIRNDL workshop, second at SIGIR, following a series of successful BIR workshops at ECIR and other premier IR venues. In conjunction with the BIRNDL workshop, we will also hold the 4th CL-SciSumm Shared Task in Scientific Document Summarization. Reports from the shared task systems will be featured as part of a session at the workshop.



(http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/cl-scisumm2018/)



=== Important Dates ===



- Submissions deadline: May 4, 2018

- Notification: May 25, 2018

- Camera Ready Contributions: June 25, 2018

- Workshop: July 12, 2018 in Ann Arbor Michigan, USA



=== Aim of the Workshop ===



The goal of the BIRNDL workshop at SIGIR is to engage the IR community about the open problems in academic search. Academic search refers to the large, cross-domain digital repositories which index research papers, such as the ACL Anthology, ArXiv, ACM Digital Library, IEEE database, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Currently, digital libraries collect and allow access to papers and their metadata --- including citations --- but mostly do not analyze the items they index. The scale of scholarly publications poses a challenge for scholars in their search for relevant literature. Finding relevant scholarly literature is the key theme of BIRNDL and sets the agenda for tools and approaches to be discussed and evaluated at the workshop. We would also like to address the need for established, standardized baselines, evaluation metrics and test collections.



We invite papers and presentations that incorporate insights from IR, bibliometrics and NLP to develop new techniques to address the open problems in Big Science, such as evidence-based searching, measurement of research quality, relevance and impact, the emergence and decline of research problems, identification of scholarly relationships and influences and applied problems such as language translation, question-answering and summarization.



See the proceedings of the second BIRNDL workshop at SIGIR 2017 (http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1888/) and (http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2002/) and a recent report in SIGIR Forum (http://sigir.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/p107.pdf).



 



=== Workshop Topics ===



We invite stimulating as well as unpublished submissions on topics including - but not limited to - full-text analysis, multimedia and multilingual analysis and alignment as well as the application of citation-based NLP or information retrieval and information seeking techniques in digital libraries. Specific examples of fields of interests include (but are not limited to):



- Infrastructure for scientific mining and IR

- Semantic and Network-based indexing, navigation, searching and browsing in structured data

- Information extraction and parsing tasks in scientific papers

- Population of a science knowledge base and performing inference on it

- Discourse structure identification and argument mining from scientific papers

- Summarisation and question-answering for scholarly DLs;

- Bibliometrics, citation analysis and network analysis for IR

- Task based user modelling, interaction, and personalisation

- Recommendation for scholarly papers, reviewers, citations and publication venues

- Measurement and evaluation of quality and impact

- Metadata and controlled vocabularies for resource description and discovery; Automatic metadata discovery, such as language identification

- Disambiguation issues in scholarly DLs using NLP or IR techniques; Data cleaning and data quality

- Evaluation baselines, metrics and test collections for research problems in IR



For the paper session, we especially invite descriptions of running projects and ongoing work as well as contributions from industry. Papers that investigate multiple themes directly are especially welcome.



=== The CL-SciSumm Shared Task ===



The CLSciSumm18 corpus is expected to be of interest to a broad community including those working in computational linguistics and natural language processing, text summarization, discourse structure in scholarly discourse, paraphrase, textual entailment and text simplification.



The task constitutes automatic scientific paper summarization in the Computational Linguistics (CL) domain. The output summaries will be of two types: faceted summaries of the traditional self-summary (the abstract) and the community summary (the collection of citation sentences ‘citances’). We also propose to group the citances by the facets of the text that they refer to.



At SIGIR 2018, we will hold the 4th Computational Linguistics (CL) Scientific Summarization Shared Task http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cl-scisumm2018/ which is sponsored by Microsoft Research Asia. This task follows up on the successful CLSciSumm-2017 @ SIGIR 2017, CLScisumm-2016 task @ JCDL 2016, Newark, NJ, USA and a Pilot Task conducted as a part of the BiomedSumm Track at the Text Analysis Conference 2014 (TAC 2014). In this task, a training corpus of ten topics from CL research papers was released. Participants were invited to enter their systems in a task-based evaluation.



=== Submission Information ===



- Research track: All submissions must be written in English, following the Springer LNCS author guidelines (max. 6 pages for short and 12 pages for full papers; exclusive of unlimited pages for references) and should be submitted as PDF files to EasyChair (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=birndl2018). All submissions will be reviewed by at least two independent reviewers. Please be aware of the fact that at least one author per paper needs to register for the workshop and attend the workshop to present the work. In case of no-show the paper (even if accepted) will be deleted from the proceedings and from the program submissions and reviewing will be managed by the EasyChair conference management system.



- Poster track: We welcome submissions detailing original, early findings, works in progress and industrial applications of bibliometrics and IR for a special poster session, possibly with a 2-minute presentation in the main session. Some research track papers will also be invited to the poster track instead, although there will be no difference in the final proceedings between poster and research track submissions. These papers should follow the same format as the research track papers.



- Shared Task: Teams that wish to participate in the CL Shared Task track at BIRNDL 2018 are invited to register on EasyChair by April 15th with a title and a tentative abstract describing their approach. Participants are advised to register as soon as possible in order to receive timely access to evaluation resources, including development and testing data. Registration for the task does not commit you to participation - but is helpful to know for planning. All participants who submit system runs are welcome to present their system at the BIRNDL Workshop in the poster session, while the best performing system will be invited to present their paper in the main session. Dissemination of CL-SciSumm work and results other than in the workshop proceedings is welcomed, but the conditions of participation specifically preclude any advertising claims based on these results. Any questions about conference participation may be sent to the organizers mentioned below.

Job advertisements in contrast are a rich source of information. They are very up to date and convenient and quite cheap to collect – in the case of using online sources. But there is also a challenge: The vast amount of information in job advertisements is completely unstructured, which means we have to cope with natural language texts and we have to dig for the information before analysing the data.



From the perspective of natural language processing job ads are a remarkable text species. On one hand we can see extensive constraints concerning content and shape. On the other hand the margins inside these constraints are used very actively. These points matter for the performance of well established text mining solutions applied on job ads and for classification and extraction tasks.



With the conference we aim to bring together researchers from different disciplines with a focus on text analysis in the special domain of job ads or adjacent fields of interest. The conference day will be organized in three or four sessions, depending on the topics of the submissions received.



The conference languages will be English and German. We welcome oral contributions in both English and German. Participants who will speak in German are encouraged to prepare their slides in English. 





Suggested topics for submissions



Infrastructure for information extraction and text mining on job ads:

- Corpora: availability, generation, annotations, ..

- Ontologies: generation and availability

- NLP-Pipelines (language and domain specific)

- Taxonomies / Classification Systems from and for the analysis of job ads



Tasks:

- Automatic classification of job ads 

- Information extraction from job ads

- Automated Coding: occupations, branches, ..

- Semantic Similarity strategies for entity classification



Methods:

- Natural language processing methods for job ads

- Rule based systems vs. machine learning approaches

- Deep Learning strategies

- Linguistic Aspects

- Big Data: Challenges to cope with big corpora

Financial Technology (FinTech) has seen billions of dollars of investments since 2010. With the evolving relationship with banking customers, financial institutions are eager to accelerate and harness the knowledge of new technologies and business models into launching competitive products and services. Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially the recent surge of interest in Deep Learning and Machine Learning technologies, has attracted attention from both academia and industry. The use of AI has been widely adopted in different disciplines such as information retrieval, natural language processing, and machine learning, to name a few. Notably, such technologies perform best when the training data is huge, and the abundance of many multi‑years of organizations’ financial data appears to be a good candidate for utilization. However, the use of AI technologies to unravel deep knowledge in the financial domain still appears to be limited, and works related to it have been scattered in different venues.



This workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss new ideas, trends and results concerning the application of AI-based methods to the Financial domain, especially in the area of mining financial data intelligence.



Topics include, but not limited to:



-Applications of machine learning to financial software analysis

-Natural language processing for analysing financial data

-Human-machine collaboration for financial software systems

-Prediction models to support software quality and performance evaluation

-Analysis of financial software repositories and multi-source financial data, 

 including risk data analysis

-Mining financial data

-Applications of machine learning in algorithmic trading



Submission Guidelines:



Authors are invited to submit original papers, which have not been published elsewhere and are not currently under consideration for another journal, conference or workshop.



 Paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of eight pages (free of charge) and 10 pages (including a charge for two pages), in the IEEE 2-column format (https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html), including the bibliography and any possible appendices.



Submissions longer than ten pages will be rejected without review. Authors are recommended to stick to the eight pages limit.



The authors shall omit their names from the submission. For formatting templates with author and institution information, simply replace all these information items in the template by ""Anonymous"".



 In the submission, the authors should refer to their own prior work like the prior work of any other author, and include all relevant citations. This can be done either by referring to their prior work in the third person or referencing papers generically. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on clustering, instead of saying ""We extend our earlier work on distance-based clustering (Smith 2005)"", you might say ""We extend Smith's earlier work (Smith 2005) on distance-based clustering"". The authors shall exclude citations to their own work which is not fundamental to understanding the paper, including prior versions (e.g., technical reports, unpublished internal documents) of the submitted paper. Hence, do not write: ""In our previous work [3]"" as it reveals that citation 3 is written by the current authors. The authors shall remove mention of funding sources, personal acknowledgments, and other such auxiliary information that could be related to their identities. These can be reinstituted in the camera-ready copy once the paper is accepted for publication. The authors shall make statements on well-known or unique systems that identify an author, as vague in respect to identifying the authors as possible. The submitted files shall be named with care to ensure that author anonymity is not compromised by the file names. For example, do not name your submission ""Smith.pdf"",  instead give it a name that is descriptive of the title of your paper, such as ""ANewApproachtoClustering.pdf"" (or a shorter version of the same).



Algorithms and resources used in a paper should be described as completely as possible to allow reproducibility. This includes experimental methodology, empirical evaluations, and results. Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly available whenever possible. In addition, authors are strongly encouraged to also report, whenever possible, results for their methods on publicly available datasets.



 All submissions will be reviewed by at least three reviewers. At least one author of each accepted paper must complete the conference registration and present the paper at the conference, in order for the paper to be included in the proceedings and conference program.

Most of this information is available as text. News portals disseminate political stories at unprecedented rates, politicians and political elites advertise their own messages through social media outlets and crowdsourcing provides new affordable and quick venues for asking citizens what they think about politics. With political texts at our fingertips, vexing research questions are emerging.



Extracting, organizing, and analyzing large amounts of textual information can be quite resource-intensive with many political scientists lacking the skills necessary for dealing with such data. Fortunately, recent developments of cutting edge computational technologies such as natural language-processing, machine learning, and information extraction techniques has made research utilizing text-as-data more accessible and appealing.



On the other hand, computational scholars equipped with novel technologies and linguistic solutions often have less experience with social science theories and less contextual knowledge about political data. There is a mutual benefit in connecting disparate worlds of computational text analysis and political science in analyzing political research problems. The aim of this conference is to facilitate this multidisciplinary cooperation.



We are interested in contributions on computational approaches in analysing political text such as government speeches, political debates, social media, media content, party manifestos and/or legislation.



This conference is looking for, but not limited to, contributions from the following topics with a focus on politically relevant data:

• text categorization

• topic modeling

• information extraction

• corpus analysis

• sentiment analysis

• stance classification and ideal point estimation 

• argumentation mining

• political reputation analysis

• techniques for multilingual text analysis

• other language technologies



INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS



Authors are invited to submit abstracts (up to 500 words) in the topic areas of the conference. Abstracts should be submitted electronically via the EasyChair conference submission website.



After acceptance, authors should prepare short papers (may consist of up to five (5) double column pages of content, with two (2) additional pages for references). All accepted abstracts will be published in the format of short papers in the conference proceedings and disseminated electronically before the conference.



Authors of selected high-quality contributions will be invited to extended papers for consideration in a special issue of a selected interdisciplinary journal. These submissions will undergo the journal’s regular peer-review process.



LOCATION

Call for Papers and Shared Task Participation

The 1st International Workshop of AI Werewolf and Dialog System (AIWolfDial2019)

Collocated with INLG 2019 conference, October 29, 2019, Tokyo, Japan 

https://aiwolfdial.kanolab.net/

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



( Workshop aims )



""Are You a Werewolf?"", or ""Mafia"" (hereafter ""werewolf game""), is a communication game conducted solely through discussion. Players must exert their cognitive faculties fully in order to win. In the game, players must hide information, in contrast to perfect information games such as chess or Reversi. Each player acquires secret information from other players’ conversations and behavior and acts by hiding information to accomplish their objectives. Players are required persuasion for earning confidence, and speculation for detecting fabrications.

We employ this werewolf game as a novel way of evaluations for dialog systems. While studies of dialog systems are very hot topics recently, they are still insufficient to make natural conversations with consistent context, or with complex sentences. One of the fundamental issues is a lack of an appropriate evaluation. 

Because the werewolf game forces players to deceive, persuade, and detect lies, neither inconsistent nor vague response are evaluated as “unnatural”, losing in the game. Our werewolf game competition and evaluation could be a new interesting evaluation criteria for dialog systems, but also for imperfect information game theories.

In addition, the werewolf game allows any conversation, so the game includes both task-oriented and non-task-oriented conversations. This aspect would provide a handy intermediate goal rather than to create a general dialog system from scratch.

( Shared task )



Background



We have been annually holding the AI werewolf contests under the AI Werewolf project. The AI werewolf contest has two divisions, the protocol division and the natural language division. The protocol division asks participants to implement an AI werewolf player agent that communicates in a middle language called the AI werewolf protocol. The natural language division asks participants to implement an AI werewolf agent that communicates in natural language. We follow the previous configurations of the natural language division in our AIWolfDial2019 shared task.

The Werewolf Game in this Shared Task



Agents of the AIWolfDial2019 shared task will play the werewolf game of five players, including roles of a seer, a werewolf, a possessed, and two villagers. Players do not know other players' roles. All players, other than the werewolf, are humans. 

 A game consists of a couple of days, continuing until the human team or the werewolf team survives. A werewolf can specify and attack another player in the end of the day; the attached player will be eliminated from the game. All of players are required to vote to another player, and a player voted most will be eliminated from the game. When humans survive, the villager team wins. When a werewolf survives, the werewolf team wins. A possessed is a human but belongs to the werewolf team. A seer can specify another player in the end of the day, then either human or werewolf is notified. 



Language Requirement



A shared task participant of AIWolfDial2019 is required to implement an AI werewolf agent that communicate either in English or Japanese. Agents of the Japanese language are required to make an English version, at least by using machine translation internally.  



AIWolf Agent APIs



A shared task participant of AIWolfDial2019 is required to implement an AI werewolf agent that connects to our AIWolf server via network. Therefore, there is no limitation on the client side hardware/software other than the network I/O specifications. The AIWolf project provides APIs to implement your agent.  http://aiwolf.org/en/server describes how to implement your agent in Java. Other libraries include .NET and Python. We will provide a sample agent code and a server to connect and test your agent.



Agent Specification



- Day 0 has greetings only.

- The end of Day 0 has an inspection by a seer, and the game starts from Day 1. 

- After Day 1, the end of the days have votes by all players and an attack by a werewolf. Vote, attack, inspection are made via specific APIs (network communications). 

- A day consists of a couple turns, where all of agents can make a talk for each turn, receiving talks of previous turns. 

- An agent should make a talk within a specified periods after a talk request is sent. 

- During days, Agents can communicate anything in natural language.  A talk should consists of normal letters and punctuations only. An agent returns ""Skip"" when nothing to talk, returns ""Over"" if nothing to talk anymore in that day.   

- Use Agent[0x] (e.g. Agent[05], x is 1-5)  to mention other agents．

- An anchor e.g. ""))Agent[0x]"" could be inserted at the beginning of a talk to refer to another agent, to whom your agent with to talk with. That agent is assumed to respond something to your agent by using an anchor.



Testing Your Agent System Beforehand



We will provide an AIWolf server running, where participants can try connecting with dummy agents to check their system behavior. Participants are required to check their systems certainly work before the shared task run.  



Shared Task Run and System Evaluation



 A shared task participant of AIWolfDial2019 is required to implement an AI werewolf agent that connects to our AIWolf server at the specified timing.  We evaluate this play's logs by a couple of reviewers, performing subjective evaluations.  



Registration



- A team should send a mail to aiwolf at kanolab.net (replace at by @) to register the shared task, describing your team name, a contact e-mail address, names and affiliations of your members (please mark a contact person when a team consists of multiple members).  There is no fee required to register/participate the shared task.

- Participants should submit a system design description document to the organizers. This document and logs of the games might be used for research purpose and included and published in our overview paper without any further permission. Participants are encouraged to submit a paper to the workshop.

- Reviewers will perform subjective evaluations on the game logs. Games will be between agents, and/or human players.

Conversation is an essential social activity for humans. Intelligent systems that can handle natural language are actually deployed on personal or home devices or embedded in humanoid robots, and try to enable social interactions between computers and humans in order to assist, enable, or entertain. Even though they have significantly improved their abilities in recognizing and synthetizing speech, they often fail to meet expectations of having a real dialogue with humans. Indeed, they essentially try to provide a more or less adequate imitation of how humans converse, bringing the interlocutor into stereotyped conversations, but without developing real understanding of language or learning and using robust and meaningful representations of physical concepts, objects and events of the external world. This workshop is intended to provide an overview of the research being carried out in the areas of Cognitive and Neural systems designed to acquire capabilities for language learning, understanding, production and grounding, interactively or autonomously from data, also operating on portable and embedded devices or with preliminary quantum computing developments. To this aim, the workshop aims to gather researchers with broad expertise in various fields — computer vision and natural language processing, cognitive science and psychology, artificial intelligence and robotics, computational modeling and neuroscience — to discuss their cutting edge work in these exciting areas with original contributions covering the whole range of theoretical and practical aspects, technologies and systems.

AIMS AND SCOPE

--------------------------



Social media provide a wealth of information that reveals insights into current affairs and ongoing events. A careful exploitation of this information can be of help to enrich numerous applications with fresh insights. Example applications include news reporting, disaster coordination, law enforcement, health emergencies such as infectious disease outbreaks, and prediction of election or referendum outcomes. This presents new challenging issues for the research community in order to quickly make sense of torrential social streams as they come out, and to make the most from the fresh knowledge available from these streams. The aim of this special issue is to disseminate contributions that report on novel techniques and applications that make the most of the information gathered from social media in a (near) real-time fashion.



Streams collected from social media have attracted a wide community of researchers to study the knowledge that can be garnered from information shared on social media. Research in this field has focused on many different aspects such as search, summarization, trend detection, prediction, and recommendation, among others. While research that exploits social media data offline gained popularity in the first decade of social media growth, processing this data in real-time is now picking up momentum. Processing social media in real-time involves a number of novel challenges to the area of social media research, such as processing streams of data online due to the inability to store and index everything; having to make early decisions observing only the first bits of a growing trend, where the next part of the trend is yet to be observed; or collecting time-aware relevance judgements for information whose relevance drops or whose validity expires over time.





TOPICS OF INTEREST

--------------------------------



Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):



* Real-time search in social streams.

* Summarization of social streams as the information is collected.

* Evaluation as a service for real-time analysis of social streams.

* Early detection of trends, news, and events.

* Real-time recommendation of information, who to follow, etc.

* Real-time classification and clustering.

* Real-time social network analysis.

* Behavioral prediction.

* Real-time sentiment analysis and opinion mining.

* Real-time user modeling.

* Real-time natural language learning, processing and understanding.

* Real-time verification and fact-checking.

* Semantic web approaches for real-time analysis of social streams, including continuous semantics, and application of continuously updated knowledge in improving insights and prediction.

Translatology is the theoretical and practical study of translation. It combines insights from linguistics, the humanities, cognitive and computer science to understand the process of translating between languages and the particular features characterizing language in translation. Central concepts of contemporary translatology are translationese, linguistic patterns that tend to make translations more similar to each other than to texts originally written in their target language; and variation, which refers to the fact that different types of translations, such as written translations vs. interpreting, display systematic linguistic differences. 



The Workshop on Modelling Translation: Translatology in the Digital Age seeks to facilitate collaboration and knowledge exchange between researchers in linguistics, AI, CL, NLP, translation studies, cognitive and computer science focusing on modeling translation from diverse angles, such as variation in translation, machine translation, translation quality assessment and translationese. Specifically, the workshop aims to foster innovative research at the intersection between machine and human translation modeling by applying concepts from translation studies to machine translation or using machine translation techniques to explore research questions in translatology. We encourage research on modeling aspects of translation, including word embeddings, neural or statistical machine translation, feature-based text classification, syntactic and semantic parsing, monolingual or multilingual language models, text generation, and stylometry.



We invite papers on all relevant research areas, including but not limited to:



Translationese detection and analysis through quantitative means

Improving understanding of translation in the context of NLP

Analysis and interpretation of variation in translation

Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of translation models

Contextualized and multimodal translation analysis

Computational semantics and pragmatics applied to translation studies

Sentiment and emotion analysis of translations

Human translation quality assessment and evaluation

Cognitive and computational insights of variation in translation and translationese 

Computational models of translation types such as communicative translation, semantic translation, transcreation.

Presentation of new corpora for translation studies, such as literary translation corpora, interpreting transcript datasets.

Translation and Post-editing interfaces

Cognitive modeling of translation processes, including cognitive load measurements 

We welcome all kinds of contributions addressing the topics mentioned above.

The 2nd International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Informal Text  (NLPIT 2016)

In conjunction with The World Wide Web Conference (WWW 2016)

April 11-15, 2016, Montreal, Canada

http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~badiehm/nlpit2016/

###############################################################################################

Overview

###########

The rapid growth of Internet usage in the last two decades adds new challenges to understand the informal user generated content (UGC) on the Internet. Textual UGC refers to textual posts on social media, blogs, emails, chat conversations, instant messages, forums, reviews, or advertisements that are created by end-users of an online system. A large portion of language used on textual UGC is informal. Informal text is the style of writing that disregards language grammars and uses a mixture of abbreviations and context dependent terms. The straightforward application of state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing approaches on informal text typically results in significantly degraded performance due to the following reasons: the lack of sentence structure; the lack of enough context required; the seldom entities involved; the noisy sparse contents of users' contributions; and the untrusted facts contained. It is the aim of this work- shop to bring the attention of researchers to the opportunities and challenges involved in informal text processing. In particular, we are interested in discussing informal text modeling, normalization, mining, and understanding in addition to various application areas in which UGC is involved.



Topics

###########

We invite submissions on topics that include, but are not limited to, the following core NLP approaches for informal UGC: language identification, classification, clustering, filtering, summarization, tokenization, segmentation, morphological analysis, POS tagging, parsing, named entity extraction, named entity disambiguation, relation/fact extraction, semantic annotation, sentiment analysis, language normalization, informality modeling and measuring, language generation, handling uncertainties, machine translation, ontology construction, dictionary construction, etc.



Submission

###########

Authors are invited to submit original work not submitted to another conference or workshop. Workshop submissions could be a full paper or short paper. Paper length should not exceed 10 pages for full papers and 5 pages for short papers. All papers should be formatted according to the ACM SIG Proceedings template (http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates). Papers in PDF can be sent via the EasyChair Conference System (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nlpit2016). Each submission will receive, in addition to a meta-review, at least 2 peer double-blind reviews. Therefore, the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity must be avoided. Each full paper will get 25 minutes presentation time. Short papers will get 5 minutes presentation time in addition to a poster. Beside papers, we also plan to have an invited talk by a renowned scientist on a topic relevant for the workshop. Workshop proceedings will be published as part of the WWW2016 workshop proceedings. To contact the NLPIT 2016 organization team, please send an e-mail to: nlpit2016@easychair.org.

Introduction

================

The 2013 Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence (TAAI 2013) is the 18th annual conference sponsored by the Taiwanese Association for Artificial Intelligence (TAAI) and one of the most important annual academic meetings on Artificial Intelligence in Taiwan. The conference will be held during 6-8 December 2013 in Taipei, Taiwan. 



The conference is open to international participants, and the number of international participants from various countries increases constantly in the past few years. In particular, stable interchange activities between TAAI and the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence (JSAI) commenced in 2012 in the form of Internationally Organized Sessions in JSAI annual meetings. 



TAAI actively participates in and contributes to international research communities in recent years. We hosted the Tenth International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems in 2011 (AAMAS 2011) and the Third Asian Conference on Machine Learning in 2011 (ACML 2011). TAAI members and the host of TAAI 2013, National Chengchi University, also organize the 27th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information, and Computation in 2013 (PACLIC 27). 



The purpose of TAAI conferences is to bring together researchers, engineers, and practitioners to present and exchange ideas, results, and experiences in AI technologies and applications. To this end, the conferences typically invite prestigious international researchers for keynote speeches. The conferences also consist of international track, domestic track, and technical workshops with refereed papers, and include demonstrations/exhibition track, computer-game tournaments/competitions and panel discussions. High quality research papers are solicited and will be published in a post-conference proceedings in IEEE digital libraries (indexed in EI/Compendix afterwards). Best paper awards are conferred, and selected papers will be extended to be published in special issues of journals with SCIE and EI indexing, including Journal of Information Science and Engineering, Soft Computing, and Web Intelligence and Agent Systems.



The demonstration/exhibition track, that allows live presentation of the research results with functioning systems, attracted a lot of realistic AI applications in 2012. This track will be seriously expanded in 2013, and multiple awards will be offered for innovative AI applications.

Special issue information

-------------------------



Sentiment analysis (SA) is the field of natural language processing that deals with the automatic comprehension of opinions shared by users across different media. The traditional application of SA is to scan the opinions of users written on social networks and websites to find out how people perceive a product or service—which aspects are working and which have to be improved. This has caused a surge of technological solutions for SA, leading to the development of a wide range of systems, from those based on knowledge that makes use of lexical, syntactic and semantic information to those that are based on supervised learning through the creation of large pre-trained models of deep neural networks. These systems allow SA to be applied to areas that go beyond the product perceptions and written text.



Current challenges include analyzing texts in which segments written in one language are mixed with segments written in another language (code switching) or in which some elements are written in a language using morphological and syntactic structures from another language (code mixing); jointly analyzing the information provided by images and video together with the associated text (captions, subtitles, descriptions, etc.), so common in the web nowadays; extending sentiment analysis techniques so that they are not only able to determine people’s emotions but also their behavior, to aid in the prevention of sexism, racism, abuse and harassment on social networks; determining people’s mental health in order to alert serious conditions, such as depression and suicidal tendencies; to give just a few examples. In this Special Issue, we thus focus on approaches defining models and resources to deal with new challenging applications of SA technology in an effective manner.



The topics of interest include but are not limited to:



1) Multilingual sentiment analysis;

2) Sentiment analysis for low-resource languages;

3) Multimedia sentiment analysis from video, image and text;

4) Sentiment analysis for political, social and economic analysis;

5) Sentiment analysis for security monitoring;

6) Sentiment analysis for detecting sexism, racism, bullying and harassment;

7) Sentiment analysis for health;

8) Language resources for emerging applications of SA.

++ Overview ++ 

The increasing availability of text information in the form of news articles, comments or posts in social networks poses new challenges for those who aim to understand the storyline of an event. Although understanding natural language text has improved over the last couple of years with several research works emerging on the grounds of information extraction and text mining, the problem of constructing consistent narrative structures is yet to be solved. It is not only the algorithms that need to be improved, but also the state-of-the-art that needs to advance in order to provide methods that automatically identify, interpret and relate the different elements of a narrative which will be likely spread from different sources. In this workshop we aim to foster the discussion of recent advances in the link between Information Retrieval (IR) and formal narrative representations from texts. More specifically, we aim to capture a wide range of multidisciplinary issues related to the text-to-narrative-structure and to its various related tasks. This is a very rich line of research that poses many challenging problems in information retrieval, text mining, information extraction, computational linguistics and automatic production of media content. 



++ List of Topics ++

Research works submitted to the workshop should foster the scientific advance on all aspects of storyline generation from texts including but not limited to narrative and content generation, formal representation, and visualization of narratives. This includes the following topics:

Call for Special Issue on Trust and Veracity of Information in Social Media





Submission deadline: March 24, 2015



Special Issue page: http://tois.acm.org/Call_for_special_issue010215.html





Motivation



From a business and government point of view there is an increasing need to interpret and act upon information from large-volume media, such as Twitter, Facebook and Web news. However, knowledge gathered from online sources and social media comes with a major caveat - it cannot always be trusted, nor is it always factual and of high quality. Rumors tend to spread rapidly through social networks, especially in circumstances where their veracity is hard to establish. Researchers have found that people read and rely on untrusted sources for various reasons, the main ones being their interestingness, entertainment value, a friend's online recommendation, or a search engine result. A 2012 report from Pew Internet Research on the future of big data argues that even though by 2020 big data is likely to have a transformational effect on our knowledge and understanding of the world, there is also high risk of ""distribution of harms"" due to the abundance of inaccurate and false information.



This special issue will focus on the problem of modelling and assessing the trust and veracity of content and information posted in social media, including but not limited to automatic detection, tracking, and visualization of deceptive content, rumors and malicious campaigns, and their spread across media, languages and social networks. The aim of this multidisciplinary special issue is to bring together researchers from Information Retrieval, Web Science, Data Mining, Social Network Analysis, Social Computing, Information Visualization, Natural Language Processing, Multimedia and Human-Computer Interaction, and to combine perspectives and research from Computer Science and Sociology.





Scope & Topics of Interest



While all high-quality manuscripts focused on trust and veracity of information will be considered, we are particularly interested in approaches, applications and case studies with a focus on social media, including online social networks (Twitter, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn), media sharing applications (Flickr, Instagram, YouTube, DailyMotion, Vine, Imgur), social news (Reddit, Fark, Slashdot), blogging (Tumblr, Blogger), question-answering and knowledge exchange applications (Quora, StackExchange), location-based social networks (Foursquare), reviewing sites (epinions, yelp, TripAdvisor), collaborative authoring environments (Wikipedia), social bookmarking and tagging (Pinterest, StumbleUpon, delicious), and other applications and platforms extensively based on user-generated content and feedback (referred to simply as ""social media"" below for brevity). Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:



- Detection of rumors, misinformation, tampered content and spam in social media;

- Propagation of rumors and deceptive content within and across social networks;

- Modelling social network user and information source trustworthiness;

- Methods of quantifying trust and reliability of shared information and content;

- Identifying false claims and manipulations in user-generated content;

- Using inference and machine learning to distinguish between rumors and facts;

- Identifying false claims and manipulations in user-generated content;

- Qualitative studies of rumors and deception in social media;

- Using Linked Open Data as a factual knowledge source;

- Spatio-temporal grounding of rumors and deceptive content;

- Annotation schemas and evaluation of trust, rumor and misinformation detection;

- Visualization of rumor propagation and spheres of influence;

- Case studies of rumor and deception detection as currently practiced in real-world settings (e.g., digital journalism, crisis response, public order situations);

- Applications of rumor and deception detection methods and tools to real-world problems (e.g., digital journalism, crisis response, environmental communication).



All accepted manuscripts are expected to make a significant scientific contribution and present a rigorous evaluation of the methods they present (e.g., a comprehensive user study should accompany any new visualization proposal).





Submission



For submission instructions and reviewing procedure, please refer to http://tois.acm.org/authors.html and add a comment in the email to the Assistant to the Editor-In-Chief that the submission is intended for the special issue on Trust and Veracity of Information in Social Media. All papers will be reviewed by three external reviewers plus at least one guest editor.

4. NLP TOOLS CONTESTS:



4.1 WORD ALIGNMENT FROM ENGLISH/IL TO IL USING PARALLEL CORPORA



Machine translation (MT) is the process of encoding the syntactic and semantic information of a source language text into a target language. In the past two decades, MT has shown very promising results particularly using Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) especially for English and other European Languages.



However, its effectiveness in translating sentences within Indian Languages (IL) and between English and Indian languages needs to be explored further. The NLP tools contest in ICON 2016 aims to collectively explore the effectiveness of word alignment techniques for ILs. Better word aligned data can be useful not only for computational (such as SMT) purposes but also for obtaining linguistic insights.



CONTEST:



In the contest, training data will be provided to the contestants. It will consist of word aligned parallel corpus for different ILs and English. The contestants will have to train their systems on the data and build systems that can perform word alignment given sentence aligned parallel corpus. They will be free to use statistical, rule-based or hybrid methods. A development corpus will also be provided to refine and improve their system. The final contest will be held in November, 2016 with the test data. A workshop will be held as a part of ICON to allow the short listed candidates to present their techniques and results.



The details about the language pairs will be announced shortly. We are likely to test word alignment in both directions for all given language pairs.



The details of the evaluation procedure and the use policy of additional resources/tools will also be announced shortly.



The contest will have three prizes:

  FIRST PRIZE: Rs.10,000/-

  SECOND PRIZE: Rs.7,500/-

  THIRD PRIZE: Rs.5,000/-



4.2 POS TAGGING FOR CODE-MIXED INDIAN SOCIAL MEDIA TEXT RATIONALE



The evolution of social media texts such as blogs, micro-blogs (e.g., Twitter), and chats (e.g., Facebook messages) has created many new opportunities for information access and language technology, but also many new challenges, making it one of the prime present-day research areas. Non-English speakers, especially Indians, do not always use Unicode to write something in social media in ILs. Instead, they use phonetic typing/ roman script/ transliteration and frequently insert English words or phrases through code-mixing and anglicisms (see the following example [1]), and often mix multiple languages to express their thoughts.



While it is clear that English still is the principal language for social media communications, there is a growing need to develop technologies for other languages, including Indian languages. India is home to several hundred languages. Language diversity and dialect changes instigate frequent code-mixing in India. Hence, Indians are multi-lingual by adaptation and necessity, and frequently change and mix languages in social media contexts, which poses additional difficulties for automatic Indian social media text processing. Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is an essential prerequisite for any kind of NLP applications.



This year we will continue the last year.s POS tagging shared-task on three widely spoken Indian languages (Hindi, Bengali, and Telugu), mixed with English.



Example 1: ICON 2016 Varanasi me hold hoga! Great chance to see the pracheen nagari!



THE CONTEST



Participants will be provided training, development and test data to report the efficiency of their POS tagging system. English-Hindi, English-Bengali, and English-Telugu language mixing will be explored. The datasets may be provided with some additional information like the languages of each word. Efficiency will be measured in terms of Precision, Recall, and F-measure. Shortlisted candidates will present their techniques and results in a special session at ICON 2016.



The contest will have three prizes:

        FIRST PRIZE: Rs.10,000/-

        SECOND PRIZE: Rs.7,500/-

        THIRD PRIZE: Rs.5,000/-





5. STUDENT PAPER COMPETITION IN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGIES



ICON-2016 announces STUDENT PAPER COMPETITION in two tracks:

  Track I : NLP (All areas)

  Track II : Linguistics (Morphology, Syntax and Semantics)



Papers may be submitted under the link on the web page. Prizes will be awarded in each track for up to two papers based on original work carried out. The prizes are::

WORKSHOP Description



The workshop will be held in conjunction with the 4th International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Systems and Informatics (AISI’18). The focus of this workshop is to shed light on the use of NLP tools and corpora in studies that have a pedagogical purpose especially for low or relatively under-resourced languages. On the other hand, the workshop aims to increase awareness of the greatest advantage of using NLP tools and corpora to prepare efficient materials for language teaching and (self)-learning. Besides, the workshop will provide a leading venue for students, researchers, and teachers to disseminate and discuss their most recent and relevant experiences and studies. Additionally, it will have oral presentation sessions as well as poster sessions in order to maximize the amount of original works that presented.



Topics of interest:

Basically, the present workshop targets two scientific issues: (1) highlighting the strengths of integration NLP tools and corpora in language teaching and learning; and (2) revealing the current challenges faced by researchers working in this area. In this regard, we invite papers that pertain to these issues including but not limited to:

* Data-driven learning

* New language resources for educational use

* Building and analysing Learner corpora

* Use of corpus-based analysis in language teaching

* NLP tools for second and foreign language learners

* Automated scoring/evaluation for written student responses

* NLP tools for special education

* Tools that automatically generate test questions

* Language-based educational games that incorporates NLP

* Teachers' knowledge and beliefs about using NLP-based systems in their teaching activities

What is Considered “Unpublished Work”?

All prior peer-reviewed publications, either at a conference or workshop, are considered published prior work. Preprints such as those on arXiv.org and technical reports that are not peer reviewed are not considered prior published work for purposes of submission. Authors must state in the online submission form the name of the workshop or preprint server and title of the non-archival version. The version submitted to NAACL HLT should be suitably anonymized and not contain references to the prior non-archival version. Reviewers will be told: “The author(s) have notified us that there exists a non-archival previous version of this paper with significantly overlapping text. We have approved submission under these circumstances, but to preserve the spirit of blind review, the current submission does not reference the non-archival version.” Reviewers are free to do what they like with this information.

MOTIVATIONS

====================

In the last few years the phenomenon of multilingual information overload has received significant attention due to the huge availability of information coded in many different languages. Recent statistics (http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/#byregion) have reported that non-English contents represent more than half of the information available on the Internet. We have in fact witnessed a growing popularity of tools that are designed for collaboratively editing through contributors across the world, which has led to an increased demand for methods capable of effectively and efficiently searching, retrieving, managing and mining different language-written document collections. The multilingual information overload phenomenon introduces new challenges to modern information retrieval systems. By better searching, indexing, and organizing such rich and heterogeneous information, we can discover and exchange knowledge at a larger world-wide scale.

However, since research on multilingual information is relatively young, important issues still remain, including:



* how to define a translation-independent representation of the documents across many languages;

* whether existing solutions for comparable corpora can be enhanced to generalize to multiple languages without depending on bilingual dictionaries or incurring bias in merging language-specific results;

* how to profitably exploit knowledge bases to enable translation-independent preserving and unveiling of content semantics;

* how to define proper indexing structures and multidimensional data structures to better capture the multi-topic and/or multi-aspect nature of the documents in a multilingual context;

* how to detect duplicate or redundant information among different languages or, conversely, novelty in the produced information;

* how to enrich and update multi-lingual knowledge bases from documents;

* how to exploit multi-lingual knowledge bases for question answering;

* how to extend topic modeling to deal with multi/cross-lingual documents;

* how to evaluate and visualize retrieval and mining results.





AIMS AND SCOPE

================================================================



The aim of this workshop, to be held in conjunction with the 2016 ECIR Conference, is to establish a venue to discuss research advances in cross-/multilingual related topics.

A major objective of this workshop is to focus on research questions that have not been deeply investigated so far. In particular, we solicit contributions that aim to consider the following aspects:



* Modeling: methods to develop suitable representations for multilingual corpora, possibly embedding information from different views/aspects, such as, e.g., tensor models and decompositions, word-to-vector models, statistical topic models, representational learning, etc.

* Learning: any unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised approach in cross/multilingual contexts.

* The use of knowledge bases to support the modeling, learning, or both stages of multilingual corpora analysis.

* Emerging trends and applications, such as, e.g., cross-view cross-/multilingual IR, multilingual text mining in social networks, etc.

*Aims and Scope* 



Multilingual approaches to natural language processing (NLP) have become increasingly popular with the field’s growing awareness of the limitations of monolingual approaches, and the realisationthat a single language can never be representative for the whole world’s linguistic diversity. One constant obstacle to multilingual NLP, is the access to sufficient labelled data in low-resource languages. This is partially alleviated by multilingual resources such as the Universal Dependencies, and Unimorph. A growing body of work has focused on transfer learning methods which often use data from relatively high-resource languages, for low-resource ones. This approach is crucial to the success of NLP for low-resource languages, as it is unfeasible to obtain labelled data for all languages in the world. Furthermore, even high-resource languages may benefit from multilingual transfer from other languages. 



*Main Topics* 

-Multilingual NLP

-Language-independent training, architecture design, and hyperparameter tuning. -Integration of typological features in multilingual learning

-Typologically inspired NLP architectures

-Cross-lingual transfer

-Low-resource NLP

-Linguistic Diversity and Fairness

-Interpretability of Multilingual Models

-Evaluation of language-independent methods

-Adaptation of monolingual methods to cross-lingual settings

-Construction / annotation of multilingual resources

-Techniques for simultaneous modelling of several languages

March 25-27, 2019

Stanford University - Palo Alto, California



This AAAI Spring Symposium will bring together researchers in privacy and researchers in either artificial intelligence (AI) or human language technologies (HLTs), so that we may collectively assess the state of the art in this growing intersection of interests. Privacy remains an evolving and nuanced concern of computer users, as new technologies that use the web, smartphones, and the internet of things (IoT) collect a myriad of personal information. Rather than viewing AI and HLT as problems for privacy, the goal of this symposium is to “flip the script” and explore how AI and HLT can help meet users’ desires for privacy when interacting with computers.



We will focus on two loosely-defined research questions:



(1) How can AI and HLT preserve or protect privacy in challenging situations?

(2) How can AI and HLT help interested parties (e.g., computer users, companies, regulatory agencies) understand privacy in the status quo and what people want?



The symposium will consist of invited speakers, oral presentations of submitted papers, a poster session, and panel discussions. This event is a successor to Privacy and Language Technologies (“PLT”), a 2016 AAAI Fall Symposium.



The symposium invites 2-6 page papers (excluding references) describing new contributions, works in progress, and positions on research in the intersection between privacy and AI/HLT. Submissions should be anonymized. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:



- AI/HLT-driven personalization of privacy assistance

- Uses of AI/HLT to enhance privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs)

- AI/HLT-assisted privacy of online social media users

- AI/HLT-driven simplification or summarization of privacy policies

- AI/HLT analysis of privacy regulations

- Privacy-preserving methods of data mining and text mining

- Ontologies and knowledge bases for privacy

- User studies of AI/HLT-driven systems that support privacy

- Ethical ramifications of AI/HLT in support of privacy



The symposium will welcome submissions from researchers who consider any combination of artificial intelligence, human language technologies, or privacy to be their primary area, recognizing that all are becoming inter-dependent.



Submissions should be in AAAI format. The review process will be double-blind, and accepted papers will be permitted up to one additional page in their final manuscripts. Proceedings will appear on CEUR-WS.org.

We are monitoring the ongoing global pandemic and will update the conference plans (e.g. moving to a virtual or hybrid format) as needed closer to the conference dates.



NAACL-HLT 2021 aims to bring together researchers interested in the design and study of natural language processing technology as well as its applications to new problem areas. With this goal in mind, NAACL-HLT 2021 invites the submission of long and short papers on creative, substantial and unpublished research in all aspects of computational linguistics. This preliminary call for papers will be updated with more details in the first full call for papers and more details will be available on the conference website.



NAACL-HLT 2021 has a goal of a diverse technical program–in addition to traditional research results, papers may present negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results."

AIMS AND SCOPE



Argumentation is a rapidly expanding multidisciplinary research area at the confluence of diverse fields such as philosophy, communication studies, logic and artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, social sciences, political sciences, and law. The contributions coming from these heterogeneous disciplines and the large number of potential applications that can be triggered by these studies have made argumentation one of the hottest topics within the artificial intelligence community with immediate relevance to the Web, distributed computing, and mobile systems. 



The Internet and the Web have inspired a variety of real-world applications for argumentation, since social media, social networks, and distributed platforms are some of the favorite sources and outlets for opinions, advice, and comments of any sort for a large share of the world population, and this type of content could very well lend itself to argumentative analysis. However, current argumentative analysis methodologies are costly and pose clear issues of scalability, since they are mainly manual or only semi-automated, and they require a great deal of expertise. Indeed, current text-based social media analytics mainly focuses on approaches such as sentiment analysis, and does not yet consider argument analysis. Sentiment analysis lets us analyze the users' opinions about certain topics, but falls short of identifying the reasons for the opinions expressed and the users' chains and patterns of reasoning.



Recently we have observed tremendous interest and rapid expansion of argumentation mining -- the process of automatically extracting arguments from unstructured text -- as a means of filling this gap. Developing enabling platforms for formal and informal argumentation in distributed settings, mining dynamic natural language text, managing consistency and accuracy in data representation, and information presentation and visualization at large are very important and certainly challenging domains for argumentation mining. Social networks and social media in particular provide high-throughput, highly heterogeneous and highly dynamic sources of data, which are likely to include significant argumentative content. With argumentation mining, the potential behind the combination of social media and argumentation studies has grown, encompassing domains such as social issues and public policy, with applications ranging from the analysis of the dynamics of social debates on the Web to the detection of anomalous behavior; and from the study of how influential arguments spread and become dominant within social networks to the role of specific users within this kind of process. 



The aim of this TOIT special section is to address the important challenges that argumentation in the Web poses, involving the perspective of distributed computing. These include, but are not limited to, the development of algorithms and architectures for mining large volumes of highly dynamic unstructured or semi-structured data especially natural language text coming from social media; the definition of appropriate models and structures that enable processing and visualizing such data; the privacy, trust, legal, and ethical issues related to the management and processing of user-generated argumentative content; the development of enabling platforms for formal and informal argumentation in distributed and agent-based environments; the management of consistent and accurate data representations; the novel use of resources such as ontologies and vocabulary systems; and the presentation of large, complex, community-based argumentative content in a usable way.

Call for Papers and Participation in the Shared Task

Website: https://sites.google.com/view/revopid-2018

Contact email: aksingh.cse@iitbhu.ac.in



Submission Deadline: April 10, 2018



This workshop aims at uncovering diverse perspectives to defining opinions. How can opinions be better summarized on online forums, in web search results or elsewhere? What relationships can be mapped between exchange of opinions on the web? We invite submissions on all such relatively unexplored dynamics of opinion mining and modeling. 



Through a workshop on Opinion Mining, Summarization and Diversification, we aim to cover the following themes, around which we invite submissions, in the form of original work and progress reports:



* Review Opinion Diversification

* Opinion Modeling techniques

* Text and Sentiment Summarization

* Opinion summarization in ranking

* Exchange of opinions as network graphs

* Joint Topic Sentiment Modeling

* Phrase Embeddings

* Sentiment Normalization on a relative scale

* Paraphrase detection in opinionated text

* Factors affecting likeability of online reviews

* Fake review detection

* Sarcasm detection in online reviews

* Bias propagation on online forums

* Evaluation of opinion diversity

* Evaluation of representativeness and diversity in ranking

* Knowledge Representation methods for opinions     





Shared Task



As part of the workshop, we will also be hosting a shared task on Review Opinion Diversification. The shared task aims to identify opinions from online product reviews. By identification of opinions, we don’t just mean string matching with a predefined list. Instead, we reward two systems equally whether they recognize ‘this product is cost-effective’ as an opinion or, instead, ‘this product is inexpensive’ or ‘this product is worth the money.’ We have an annotated dataset of 80+ products, with more than 10,000 reviews in totality, each review being labelled with its constituent opinions in the form of one opinion matrix per product.





Subtask A (Usefulness Ranking)



A supervised task to predict the helpfulness rating of product reviews based on review text. For a review which 3 users rated as helpful and 2 users found not-helpful, will be 3/5.



Subtask B (Representativeness Ranking)



Subtask B judges a system on its ability to tell whether a given review R1 contains a given opinion O1 or not. While R1 can be easily identified by its Reviewer ID, opinions are not labeled with words. Instead, they are identified by the other reviews that they appear in. Therefore, we ask the participants to provide an opinion matrix as output, which we will evaluate using several verified metrics.



Subtask C (Exhaustive Coverage Ranking)



This subtask aims at producing, for each product, top-k reviews from a set of reviews such that the selected top-kreviews act as a summary of all the opinions expressed in the reviews set. 



Data and Resources



The training, development and test data has been extracted and annotated from Amazon SNAP Review Dataset and will be available after registration.



Invitation



We invite participation from all researchers and practitioners. The organizers rely, as is usual in shared tasks, on the honesty of all participants who might have some prior knowledge of part of the data that will eventually be used for evaluation, not to unfairly use such knowledge. The only exceptions (to participation) are the members of the organizing team, who cannot submit a system. The organizing chair will serve as an authority to resolve any disputes concerning ethical issues or completeness of system descriptions.

held in conjunction with the SEPLN 2017 International conference

19th September 2017, University of Murcia, Murcia (Spain)





----------------------------------------------





This task focuses on the disambiguation of person names in web search results for person name queries. The search results are realistic web search results; they: are multilingual, include social media profiles, include pages that contain no reference to the person name query, and vary in the number of unique referents. This poses interesting additional challenges to earlier tasks like WePS-1, WePS-2, and WePS-3.



The organisers have compiled a corpus of 100 queries, annotated by three experts. A random sample of 65 of these queries has been released as a training set Monday, March 13th, 2017. Participants still (!) have a full month to develop their disambiguation algorithms. On Monday, May 8th, 2017, the 35 remaining test queries will be released, without annotations. Participants are requested to submit runs on test data at May 11th, 2017, and a working notes paper on Thursday, Jun 1st, 2017. The organizers will evaluate the performance of the participants, and put together a ranked list of systems. Final results of this task will be presented and discussed as part of the IberEval 2017 workshop. See the task website for details on the training corpus, how to download it, how runs will be evaluated, and for the performance scores of two basic clustering algorithms on the training set.



We cordially invite all researchers and practitioners from all fields to participate in this task: Multilingual Web Person Name Disambiguation. We also invite the participants to subscribe to our Google mailing list in order to be kept up to date with the latest news, tips, and tricks related to the task: m-wepnad at googlegroups dot com.

Overview

This workshop aims to discuss the fundamental and applied problems in social media, artificial intelligence, natural language and multimedia processing, and crowdsourcing technologies. The main goal of this event is to unite researchers who study social interactions on the Internet, as well as researchers from the related fields without whose contribution the study of social networks would become difficult or impossible. Our task is to discuss how to analyze the digital traces left behind by a person's activities and what conclusions can be made based on this analysis.



We welcome researchers from both humanities and technical sciences who study social networks and social interactions on the Internet, the relationship between the virtual and real-world identities. The task is to create an interdisciplinary platform for the integration of artificial intelligence and data mining approaches with sociological, psychological and linguistic studies. The event focuses on two main points: (1) integration of data mining and social mining approaches with the approaches from humanities and other technical disciplines, (2) integration of the natural language/multimedia processing with the personalized services on the Web.



The workshop continues a series of events including the 1st Intensive Social Media Week (2015), the AINL-ISMW FRUCT conference (2015) and the ISMW FRUCT school and conference (2016), ISMW seminar 2017.



The topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following subject areas:



• Social Mining

• Deception Detection and Personality Recognition

• Authorship and Profiling

• Social Copying Detection

• Social Media Metrics

• Data Mining for Social Networks, Multimedia and Natural Language Processing

• Sociology, Psychology, Marketing Studies of Social Networks and Social Media

• Information Retrieval in Social Media

• Crowdsourcing Technologies



Young scientists and researchers from scientific centers, students and graduates, as well as industrial partners are welcome to participate. Early registration is a cost effective way to participate in the Workshop and the 23rd FRUCT conference. All workshop papers will be published Open Access in FRUCT proceeding at no additional cost (available for free under a CC BY-ND license download from FRUCT proceedings catalog). The workshop posters and demos can be presented on the FRUCT23 Demo Session on 15 November 2018.

Submissions in Chinese should follow the formatting instructions of the ACTA Scientiarum Naturalium Universitatis Pekinensis [Format Template], without exceeding eight (8) pages in A4 (210 × 297 mm) size.

Manuscripts should be submitted electronically through the submission website. Email submissions will not be accepted. English papers should be submitted to the Main Track (https://www.softconf.com/NLPCC2018/Main-English), and Chinese papers should be submitted to the Chinese Track (https://www.softconf.com/NLPCC2018/Main-Chinese). Authors of Chinese submissions are required to provide Chinese titles in the submission system. All student first authors are encouraged to contact nlpcc@pku.edu.cn, indicating their names, affiliations, and the titles of their submissions.

High quality research papers in English will be selected for significant revision and recommended to 2 SCIE-Indexed Journals: the ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing (TALLIP), and the International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics. The revised papers will be published at the journals after successfully going through the normal review process of the journals.

All submissions should be in PDF format.



Double-Blind Reviewing:

Anonymity Requirements for Double-Blind Reviewing:

Every research paper submitted to NLPCC 2018 will undergo a ""double-blind"" reviewing process: the PC members and referees who review the paper will not know the identity of the authors. To ensure anonymity of authorship, authors must prepare their manuscript as follows:

1.Authors' names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.

2.Funding sources must not be acknowledged on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.

3.Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper.

4.The paper's file name must not identify the authors of the paper. It is strongly suggested that the submitted file be named with the assigned submission number.

5.You must also use care when referring to related previous work, particularly your own work, in the paper. For example, if you are Jane Smith, the following text gives away the authorship of the submitted paper:

In our previous work [1,2], we presented two algorithms for ... In this paper, we build on

that work by ...

Bibliography

[1]Jane Smith, ""A Simple Algorithm for ...,"" Proceedings of ACL 2007, pp. 1-8.

[2]Jane Smith, ""A More Complicated Algorithm for ...,"" Proceedings of ACL 2008, pp.33-

40.

The solution is to reference your past work in the third person (just as you would any other piece of work that is related to the submitted paper). This allows you to set the context for the submitted paper, while at the same time preserving anonymity:

In previous work [1,2], algorithms were presented for ... In this paper, we build on that

work by ...

Bibliography

[1]Jane Smith, ""A Simple Algorithm for ...,"" Proceedings of ACL 2007, pp. 1-8.

[2]Jane Smith, ""A More Complicated Algorithm for ...,"" Proceedings of ACL 2008, pp.33-

40.

It is the responsibility of authors to do their very best to preserve anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to rejection without review.

Submission details are provided on the conference website:

http://tcci.ccf.org.cn/conference/2018.

For more information about paper submission, contact program co-chair (nlpcc2018@gmail.com).

Abstract and Paper Submission

A number of high-quality workshop papers will be selected to publish in LNCS/LNAI series. Therefore, all papers submitted to the PRICAI 2016 Workshops must be formatted in Springer's Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) camera-ready style template; see the Springer's author instructions page for details. Papers (submitted and final) cannot exceed 12 pages (excluding references). Please do not include acknowledgements in submissions due to blind review. Papers must be in trouble-free, high-resolution PDF format, using Type 1 or TrueType fonts. Please only use the author-year system for your references. Please also refer to the instructions on how to prepare your paper for blind review. Electronic abstract and paper submission through the PRICAI 2016 paper submission site is required on or (preferably) before the deadline dates listed above. We cannot accept submissions by e-mail or fax. Authors will receive confirmation of receipt of their abstracts or papers, including an ID number, shortly after submission. We will contact authors again only if problems are encountered with papers.



Blind Review Instructions

Reviewing for the PRICAI Workshop papers is blind to the identities of the authors. The first page, on which the paper body begins, should include the title and abstract, but not the acknowledgments and names or affiliations of the authors. The references should include all published literature relevant to the paper, including previous works of the authors, but should not include unpublished works. When referring to one's own work, use the third person, rather than the first person. For example, say ""Previously, Walsh (Walsh 2013) has shown that...,"" rather than ""In our previous work (Walsh 2013) we have shown that...."" Try to avoid including any information in the body of the paper or references that would identify the authors or their institutions. Such information may be added to the final camera-ready version for publication.



Program committee members will identify papers they are qualified to review based on the information submitted electronically (the paper's title, keywords, and abstract). Their reviewing will be done blind to the identities of the authors and their institutions.



Policy Concerning Submissions to Other Conferences or Journals

PRICAI Workshop 2016 will not accept any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference. Authors are also required not to submit their papers elsewhere during PRICAI Workshop 2016's review period. These restrictions apply only to journals and conferences, not to workshops and similar specialized presentations with a limited audience and without archival proceedings. The restrictions also do not apply to preprints posted only on arXiv. Authors will be required to confirm that their submissions conform to these requirements at the time of submission.



Publication

Accepted papers will be allocated twelve (12) pages in the conference proceedings (with one extra page for references). Final papers found to exceed page limits and or otherwise violating the instructions to authors will not be included in the proceedings. Authors will be required to transfer copyright of their paper to Springer.

October 1-4, 2018, Turin, Italy 



AIMS and SCOPE 

The SeCredISData Special Session is especially devoted to dis-cussing the implications that Data Analysis has in tackling open is-sues related to society, and in developing applications able to tackle these issues. On the one hand, the focus of the Special Session will be given to the study and the application of affective computing and sentiment analysis to social data, which can impact on mon-itoring, analyzing and counteracting discrimination and hate speech, which are increasingly spreading phenomena in our countries also in combination with the pervasiveness of social media. Furthermore, also the applications of sentiment analysis and emotion detection in social media for the development of education, entertainment, health, e-government, and games will be considered as an interesting object of investigation. On the other hand, the Special Session will also investigate the problem of assessing the credibil-ity of information spreading across virtual communities. The dif-fusion of fake news and reviews, hoaxes, rumors, inaccurate health information, can have a negative impact on society with respect to different aspects, from influencing political elections, producing harmful effects if connected to the health of patients, to generating hate and discrimination phenomena. For all these reasons, the de-velopment of approaches that can help people in automatically as-sess the level of credibility of information is a fundamental research issue in the last years. 



TOPICS OF INTEREST 

-        Subjectivity, sentiment, and emotion detection 

-        Sentiment-based indexing, search, and retrieval 

-        Sentiment topic detection & trend discovery 

-        Multimodal emotion and sentiment detection 

-        Irony and sarcasm detection 

-        Affect in natural language and multimodal affective interaction 

-        Emotion models and ontologies of emotions 

-        Hate speech detection and ethical issues in affect and opinion detection 

-        Summarization of emotions, sentiment and affective data 

-        Sentiment analysis and emotion detection in social media to ed-ucation, entertainment, health, e-government, games

However, experts from these areas have no medium where they can meet and exchange ideas so that strong collaborations can emerge, and cross-fertilization of these areas can occur. Moreover, current courses and curricula in security do not sufficiently emphasize background in these areas and students in security and privacy are not emerging with deep knowledge of these topics. Hence, we propose a workshop that will address the research and development efforts in which analytical techniques from machine learning, data mining, natural language processing and statistics are applied to solve security and privacy challenges (“security analytics”).

Overview

This session aims to discuss the fundamental and applied problems in social media, artificial intelligence, natural language and multimedia processing, and crowdsourcing technologies. The main goal of this event is to unite researchers who study social interactions on the Internet, as well as researchers from the related fields without whose contribution the study of social networks would become difficult or impossible. Our task is to discuss how to analyze the digital traces left behind by a person's activities and what conclusions can be made based on this analysis.



We welcome researchers from both humanities and technical sciences who study social networks and social interactions on the Internet, the relationship between the virtual and real-world identities. The task is to create an interdisciplinary platform for the integration of artificial intelligence and data mining approaches with sociological, psychological and linguistic studies. The event focuses on two main points: (1) integration of data mining and social mining approaches with the approaches from humanities and other technical disciplines, (2) integration of the natural language/multimedia processing with the personalized services on the Web.



The session continues a series of events including the 1st Intensive Social Media Week (2015), the AINL-ISMW FRUCT conference (2015) and the ISMW FRUCT school and conference (2016), ISMW seminars 2017-2019.



Young scientists and researchers from scientific centers, students and graduates, as well as industrial partners are welcome to participate.



Topics of interest include the following subject areas:



• Social Mining

• Deception Detection and Personality Recognition

• Authorship and Profiling

• Social Copying Detection

• Social Media Metrics

• Data Mining for Social Networks, Multimedia and Natural Language Processing

• Sociology, Psychology, Marketing Studies of Social Networks and Social Media

• Information Retrieval in Social Media

• Crowdsourcing Technologies



Young scientists and researchers from scientific centers, students and graduates, as well as industrial partners are welcome to participate. Early registration is a cost effective way to participate in the ISMW session and the 26th IEEE FRUCT conference. All session papers will be published Open Access in FRUCT proceeding at no additional cost (available for free under a CC BY-ND license download from FRUCT proceedings catalog). The session posters and demos can be presented on the FRUCT26 Demo Session (April 23, 2020).

Traditionally, the study of information extraction, knowledge processing and language processing is performed by computer scientists, specializing in the application of computers to the processing of a natural language and large structured or semi-structured data-bases. Today, people working in information extraction, knowledge processing, and particularly in language processing often work as members of interdisciplinary teams, including linguists (specifically trained in linguistics), language experts (persons with some level of ability in the languages relevant to a given project), statisticians, and computer scientists. In general, computational linguistics draws upon the involvement of linguists, computer scientists, experts in artificial intelligence, mathematicians, logicians, cognitive scientists, cognitive psychologists, psycholinguists, anthropologists and neuroscientists, among others. Information extraction as part of knowledge processing and language processing, as well, must become more connected to the cognitive sciences through the development of cognitive semantic theories. Information extraction as part of knowledge processing is connected to artificial intelligence through the development of methods and algorithms for all aspects of language analysis and their computer implementation. We can see language analysis divided into two parts: theoretical analysis and application. The theoretical aspect includes standard areas studied in linguistics methods as semantics, syntax, and morphology or numerical methods as those used in information retrieval or text-mining. Semantic theories guide the development of lexical theories, syntactic theories and morphology. Semantic theories can be based on some specific features of computation, but at the present stage of research, there is a gap between linguistic analysis and computer applications in two senses: there are many computer applications without linguistic theoretical support and, conversely, there are a number of theoretical methods with no computer implementation. Semantic as part of computational linguistic and language processing is very related to the logic and to logics. If we accept the hypothesis that there is a logic of language and logics of natural languages, the upstream of each algorithm or method representing the basis of a AI system of language analysis is a logic and a semantic. The downstream of semantic analysis can be found in translation, automatic text generation and even automatic annotation of texts or information retrieval. Generally, the knowledge processing and particularly, the information extraction must take into account this epistemological chain for to lead to effective, robust and reliable systems.



What is the GOAL of the track?

This track is intended to present works ranking from logical, mathematical, and statistical models in syntax, semantics (logic of objects, topological theories of time and space, lexical associations, etc.) and discourse as foundations of the design and analysis to knowledge processing and natural language processing systems and especially to information extraction.



Who might be interested?

Special tracks, held in parallel with the general conference, are an integral part of the conference. They provide researchers in focused areas the opportunity to meet and present their work, and offer a forum for interaction among the broader community of artificial intelligence researchers. Topics of interest are in all areas related to artificial intelligence.



What kind of studies will be of interest?

Papers and contributions are encouraged for any work relating to Semantic, Logics and Information Extraction in AI. Topics of interest may include (but are in no way limited to): 



1. Philosophy of language – new developments, 

2. Cognitive semantics, 

3. Logics of language, 

4. Language modeling, 

5. Computational linguistics (lexicology; morphology; syntax; semantics), 

6. Information extraction, 

7. Domain ontologies, linguistic ontologies, 

8. Knowledge processing, 

9. Translation, 

10. Text-mining.



Note: We invite original papers (i.e. work not previously submitted, in submission, or to be submitted to another conference during the reviewing process).



Submission Guidelines 

Interested authors should format their papers according to AAAI formatting guidelines. The papers should be original work (i.e., not submitted, in submission, or submitted to another conference while in review). Papers should not exceed 6 pages (4 pages for short papers and abstracts for posters). Regular papers and short papers are due by November 21, 2016. Poster abstracts are due by February 6, 2017.

INTRODUCTION

In Digital Libraries, which can often span several epochs, time is a critical factor. It is the means by which understanding, searching, and exploring these collections of data.

Temporal dynamics, i.e. time-based patterns and trends, underpin language usage, entity references, and cultural and economic trends. Users accessing the information contained in Digital Libraries have to deal with their partial knowledge of these phenomena (word meaning variation, entity temporal ambiguity, specific events and time-related trends), as well as their own temporal evolution, i.e. their change in interests, preferences, and goals over time. Intercepting, representing, and predicting these dynamics is fundamental to the intelligent information access in Digital Libraries.

This workshop proposes to bring together researchers and practitioners from different backgrounds in order to identify and discuss research trends, challenges, and new opportunities related to the time-aware intelligent access to Digital Libraries.



TOPICS OF INTEREST

We invite papers that pertain to the workshop theme including but not limited to:

- Diachronic analysis of language

- Time-aware Information Retrieval for Digital Libraries

- Time-aware Recommender Systems for Digital Libraries

- Timeline Summarization

- Time-aware User Modeling for Digital Libraries

- Event detection

- Time-aware entity disambiguation

- Topic detection and tracking

- Temporal clustering

- Timeline interfaces

- Temporal queries

- Historical studies and computational history

- Topic and entity evolution

- Opinion changes over time

- Web archive-related topics

Only previously unpublished papers from authors who have already earned a doctorate will be considered. Chapters should be fully referenced and written in a scholarly style for an audience of linguists, animal communication researchers, and scientists engaged in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). 



Given that we have no examples of extraterrestrial intelligence to study, and no empirical proof that such intelligence even exists, there are significant methodological constraints on attempting to anticipate the nature of extraterrestrial language. Chapters that highlight these constraints are especially welcome. 



Authors who address possible contact between human and extraterrestrial intelligence should focus on scenarios in which contact is via radio or laser signals transmitted across interstellar space, rather than via face-to-face contact. Proposals that discuss of the possibilities and/or limitations of using natural language to communicate with extraterrestrial intelligence at interstellar distances are welcome.

https://project-hobbit.eu/challenges/qald2017/



The key challenge for Question Answering over Linked Data is to translate a user’s information need into a form such that it can be evaluated using standard Semantic Web query processing and inferencing techniques.



The main task of QALD therefore is the following: Given one or several RDF dataset(s) as well as additional knowledge sources and natural language questions or keywords, return the correct answers or a SPARQL query that retrieves these answers.



In order to focus on specific aspects and challenges, we propose the following three tasks:



Task 1: Multilingual question answering over DBpedia

Task 2: Hybrid question answering

Task 3: Large-Scale question answering over RDF

Task 4: Wikidata-based question answering



Submission

The QALD challenge provides an automatic evaluation tool (GERBIL QA integrated into the HOBBIT platform) that is open source and available for everyone to re-use. This tool is accessible online, so that participants can simply upload the answers produced by their system or even check their system via a web service.



Each experiment will have a citable, time-stable and archivable URI which is both human- and machine-readable. It is mandatory for each system to provide an endpoint URL wrapped inside a provided Docker container after the submission in order to be evaluated with GERBIL QA.



We are accepting papers (up to 5 pages) describing the submitted approach and evaluation results. Submissions must be in English and in PDF, formatted in the style of the Springer Publications format for Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).



Papers should be submitted through the EasyChair system (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=qald2017) no later than midnight Friday March 10th, 2017, Hawaii Time. Submissions will be reviewed by members of the challenge program committee.

Motivation and Aims

--------------------------



Natural Language Processing is becoming more and more ubiquitous as technologies become omnipresent in our daily life. This involves a huge effort to develop language-based interfaces, text analytics, search engines, writing assitants among other systems and their related tools and resources. Adaptation has been key to facilitate rapid development of language-based systems, with reuse of existing resources as alternatives to creating tools and resources from scratch. These approaches have benefited from the recent surge of complex Machine Learning approaches as applied to NLP tasks. This is the case for Semi-supervised and Unsupervised Learning, Active Learning, Domain Adaptation, and even Representation Learning and Deep Learning, which have had a very positive impact on NLP tasks and applications.



This workshop aims to provide a meeting point for researchers working on the portability of language resources and methodologies across languages and domains, with a special focus on exploiting available knowledge as a base to facilitate and enhance new developments. We understand that there is a common factor between tasks like porting a parser between related languages, adapting a dialogue system for a different domain, using rules inferred from an annotated corpus together with an unannotated corpus to port an information extraction system to another domain, or simplifying texts for different kinds of readers, among others. We believe that sharing insights on such approaches will be enriching and will contribute to a better understanding of the problems and solutions.



We expect that themes like Representation Learning, Deep Learning and Active Learning, and their successful applications to various areas of NLP, will raise interesting, intellectually challenging discussions. 





Workshop Topics

--------------------------



Contributions may present results from completed as well as ongoing research, with an emphasis on novel approaches, methods, ideas, and perspectives. 



The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:



Semi-supervised learning, Deep Learning, Active learning and Representation learning for domain adaptation, language portability and task portability

Adaptation and reuse of tools and resources for closely related languages

Adaptation of highly valuable resources, like treebanks, to languages not closely related

Linguistic issues in language portability: false friends, asymmetric discretization of semantic continuum

Learning from multiple domains

Development of multi-domain datasets 

Evaluation paradigms for complex learning

Domain adaptation for specific applications: parsing, machine translation, information extraction, document classification, sentiment analysis and author attribution and profiling





Format of submissions

--------------------------



Submissions are invited for papers presenting high quality, previously unpublished research. Selection criteria include originality of ideas, correctness, clarity and significance of results and quality of presentation.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

 

All papers must be submitted in .pdf format through the conference management system at https://www.softconf.com/ranlp2019/RANLPStud/. The papers should follow the format of the main conference, described at the main RANLP website, Submission Guidelines Section (http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2019/submissions.php). All papers must have only student authors. Submission with non-student authors will not be considered for review. After eventual acceptance of the paper, the authors could add their supervisor(s) in the Acknowledgments Section. The submissions must specify the student's level (Bachelor-, Master-, or PhD) and the type of submission (Full or Short).

 

Full Papers must describe original unpublished work of the student in any topic area of the workshop. Full papers are limited to 8 pages for content, with 2 additional pages for references. 

Short Papers may describe either work in progress or a research proposal. They may also be in the style of a position paper that surveys and criticizes existing literature. Short papers must include clear directions for future research. Submissions of this type are limited to 6 pages for content, with 2 additional pages for references.

We do not allow additional pages for appendixes, which go over the above mentioned limits. If you have supplementary material, which is *not central* to the paper, such as: 

- link to the software or data,

- pre-processing decisions, model parameters, and other details which allow replication of the experiments

- guidelines, pseudo-code

- proofs or explanations

- lists of features, etc.

 

However, these additional materials should not be central to the paper. The paper submission should not rely on such materials, and should be understandable without them. The reviewers will not be asked to check these additional materials.

 

Authors may submit the same paper at several conferences. In this case, they must notify the organisers by filling in the corresponding information in the submission form, as well as notifying the contact organizer by e-mail.

REVIEWING PROCEDURE

 

The reviewing of the papers will be double-blind, so the submissions should not contain author information. Papers should not contain references such as “We previously showed at Doe (2015) …” but rather “Doe (2015) showed that…”. Non anonymous papers will be rejected.

 

Each submission will be reviewed by at least 2 reviewers from the Programme Committee, who will feature experienced researchers from all areas of NLP. The final decisions will be made based on their reviews.

 

The list of Programme Committee members will be announced in the Second CfP.

Call for Papers



Workshop at MT Summit XIV in Nice, France

September 3, 2013



Submission deadline: 26 June 2013 at 24:00 CET (GMT+1)



Machine Translation (MT) has evolved along with different types of computer-assisted translation tools and a notable progress has been achieved in improving the quality of translations. However, in spite of the recent positive developments in translation technologies, not all problems have been solved and in particular the identification, interpretation and translation of multi-word units (MWUs) still represent open challenges, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view. The low standard of analysis and translation of MWUs in translation technologies suggest that there is the need to invest in further research with the goal of improving the performance of the various translation applications.



Multi-word units (MWUs) are a complex linguistic phenomenon, ranging from lexical units with a relatively high degree of internal variability to expressions that are frozen or semi-frozen. Such units are very frequent both in everyday language and in languages for special purposes. Their interpretation and translation sometimes present unexpected obstacles even to human translators, mainly because of intrinsic ambiguities, structural and lexical asymmetries between languages, and, finally, cultural differences.



The current theoretical work on this topic deals with different formalisms and techniques relevant for MWU processing in MT as well as other translation applications, such as: automatic recognition of MWUs in a monolingual or bilingual setting; alignment and paraphrasing methodologies; development, features and usefulness of handcrafted monolingual and bilingual linguistic resources and grammars; use of MWUs in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) domain adaptation, as well as empirical work concerning their modelling accuracy and descriptive adequacy across various language pairs. At the practical level, the issue of MWU has been addressed in various MT approaches, whether knowledge-based, statistical (word-based, phrase-based or factored-based) or hybrid. In general, MWU identification and translation problems are far from being solved and there is still considerable room for improvement. There is a recent growing attention to MWU processing in MT and Translation Technologies, as it has been acknowledged that it is not possible to create large-scale applications without properly handling MWUs of all kinds.



The focus of this workshop is to address the MWU issue in a synergetic way, taking advantage of the recent developments in disciplines such as Linguistics, Translation Studies, Computational Linguistics, and Computational Phraseology.



The main aim of the Workshop is, therefore, to bring together researchers working on various aspects of MWU processing in different disciplines, in order to discuss and propose innovative ideas and methods in relation to MT and Translation Technologies. In particular, this workshop welcomes the exchange of interactions between researchers in NLP working on the computational treatment of multi-word units, experts in phraseology (including computational phraseology) working on challenging topics of their discipline, as well as translation practitioners, to the benefit of applying their latest results to advance the state of the art in MWU translation.

TOPICS



We invite the submissions of papers reporting original and unpublished research on multi-word unit (MWU) processing in Machine Translation and Translation Technologies. We encourage the representation of a broad range of areas including, but not limited to, the following:



    Lexical, syntactic, semantic and translational aspects in MWU representation

    Identification and acquisition of multi-word terms and their variants

    Automatic extraction of (multilingual) MWU resources

    MWUs in Computer-Assisted Translation

    Development and use of handcrafted MWU linguistic resources in MT

    Paraphrasing of MWUs applied to improving MT

    MWUs and word alignment techniques

    Identification and acquisition of non-compositional items

    Learning semantic information about MWUs from monolingual, parallel or comparable corpora

    Multilingualism and MWU processing

    Integration of MWUs into rule-based and statistical MT

    MT evaluation focused on MWUs and novel automatic metrics handling MWUs

    Creation of MWU-annotated corpora with a focus on translation aspects

Digital libraries that store scientific publications are becoming increasingly important in research. They are used not only for traditional tasks such as finding and storing research outputs, but also as sources for  mining this information, discovering new research trends and evaluating research excellence. The rapid growth in the number of scientific publications being deposited in digital libraries makes it no longer sufficient to provide access to content to human readers only. It is equally important to allow machines analyse this information and by doing so facilitate the processes by which research is being accomplished. Recent developments in natural language processing, information retrieval, the semantic web and other disciplines make it possible to transform the way we work with scientific publications. However, in order to make this happen, researchers first need to be able to easily access and use large databases of scientific publications and research data, to carry out experiments.



This workshop aims to bring together people from different backgrounds who:

(a) are interested in analysing and mining databases of scientific publications,

(b) develop systems, infrastructures or datasets that enable such analysis and mining, 

(c) design novel technologies that improve the way research is being accomplished or 

(d) support the openness and free availability of publications and research data.



2. TOPICS



The topics of the workshop will be organised around the following three themes:



1) Infrastructures, systems, open datasets or APIs that enable analysis of large volumes of scientific publications.



2) Semantic enrichment of scientific publications by means of text-mining, crowdsourcing or other methods.



3) Analysis of large databases of scientific publications to identify research trends, high impact, cross-fertilisation between disciplines, research excellence etc.



Topics of interest relevant to theme 1 include, but are not limited to:



- Systems, services, datasets or APIs for accessing scientific publications and/or research data, and infrastructures and systems that promote Open Access to publications (open repositories).

The existence of datasets, services, systems and APIs (in particular those that are open) providing access to large volumes of scientific 

publications and their metadata is an essential prerequisite for being able to research and develop new technologies that can transform the way people do research.



Topics of interest relevant to theme 2 include, but are not limited to:



- Novel information extraction and text-mining approaches to semantic enrichment of publications.

- Automatic categorization and clustering of scientific publications.

- New methods and models for connecting and interlinking scientific publications.

- Models for semantic representation and annotation of publications, especially those using Linked Open Data.

- Semantically enriching/annotating publications by crowdsourcing or other means.



Topics of interest relevant to theme 3 include, but are not limited to:



- New methods, models and innovative approaches for measuring impact of publications.

- New methods for measuring performance of researchers.

- New methods for measuring impact of research groups.

- Methods for identifying research trends and cross-fertilization between research disciplines.

- Applications of mining from scientific databases.



3. EXPECTED AUDIENCE



The workshop on Mining Scientific Publications aims to bring together researchers, digital library developers, practitioners from government and industry and open access enthusiasts to address the current challenges in the domain of mining scientific publications.



4. SUBMISSION FORMAT



We invite submissions related to the workshop’s topics. Long papers should not exceed 8 pages and short papers should not exceed 4 pages of the ACM style. Furthermore, we welcome demo presentations of systems or methods. A demonstration submission should consist of a maximum two page description of the system, method or tool to be demonstrated.

The abundance of opinions available on the World Wide Web represents an information repository of enormous intellectual and economic value. Automated methods to exploit this rich knowledge mine have become more and more relevant within the last decade and the availability of large amounts of data is an ideal premise for the application of empirical methods.



Although many researchers from different nations and institutes intensively work on the development of these techniques, many challenges have been left uncovered: Among the highly relevant social media are new text types, that are fairly different from the types on which research in natural language processing has been conducted for the last 20 years. The most prominent example may be Twitter; with its condensed tweets it presents a sublanguage of its own. Traditional approaches often leave questions about the true nature of opinions unanswered. The actual emotion hidden in opinionated text is still hard to uncover; current lexical resources for sentiment analysis mostly only contain information about the polarity or subjectivity of terms, lacking relevant information of their emotional category. Fear or anger are treated equally, as are hope and joy. Emotional categories are projected onto two polarities, i.e. positive and negative, which oversimplifies reality. A further important aspect requiring methodological coverage is the exact analysis of the entities participating in the event evoked by an opinion. Robust linguistic techniques embedded in data-driven methods will possibly guide the way to answer questions on the actual target of an opinion or on the peer group holding this opinion. Another challenge is the automated assignment of polarity or subjectivity labels to the plethora of sentiment-related textual data readily available on the Web. State-of-the-art learning approaches, such as weakly-supervised or semi-supervised methods or distant supervision still need to be thoroughly examined for this purpose.



Another important aspect of this workshop is its focus on multi-linguality. Therefore, submissions for approaches devised and applied on languages other than English, in particular German, are strongly encouraged.



The workshop aims for providing a platform for researchers interested in the upcoming challenges of sentiment analysis and opinion mining. It intends to attract researchers settled in computational linguistics, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence alike. The workshop will be organized by the recently founded GSCL-Interest Group on German Sentiment Analysis (IGGSA): http://www.gscl.org/ak-stimmungsanalyse-en.html.







*Topics of Interest* 



We invite contributions on, but not necessarily limited to: 

- Genre- and domain-specific sentiment analysis 

- Cross-genre and cross-domain sentiment analysis 

- Semi-supervised/weakly supervised learning for sentiment analysis 

- Contrast of machine learning vs. linguistic approaches vs. hybrid methods 

- Sentiment analysis on twitter and social media in general 

- Fine-to-coarse sentiment analysis 

- Emotion detection and classification 

- Representation of and calculus on emotions 

- Multi-lingual sentiment analysis 

- Lexical resources for opinion mining and sentiment analysis 

- Gold standards and methods for evaluation 

- Real-world applications and large-scale sentiment analysis 

- Trends and perspectives in the field 





*Important Dates* 



Paper submission deadline: July 26, 2013

Acceptance notification: August 16, 2013

Workshop: September 23, 2013 





*Submission Guidelines* 



We will accept two types of submissions: full papers and extended abstracts. Accepted papers will be published in a special issue of the Journal for Language Technology and Computational Linguistics (http://www.jlcl.org). The editors-in-chief have already approved of publishing a special issue for 2014.

All accepted full papers and extended articles qualify for an oral presentation on the workshop.

Accepted full papers also qualify for a publication in JLCL. There will be two types of acceptances “Accept as is” and “Accept with Revision”. In the latter case, a revised version of the paper has to be submitted which will undergo a second review to safeguard that necessary revisions have been sufficiently implemented.

Accepted extended abstracts will not be published in the JLCL. However, authors of selected abstracts may be invited to submit a full paper for the journal. That submission will also undergo an additional review.

The purpose of extended abstracts is to allow interesting work in progress or project reports as contributions on the workshop that are not yet ripe for publication.

The submission guidelines of this workshop (w.r.t. the format of these types of papers) will follow the guidelines of the JLCL journal:

http://www.jlcl.org/index.php?modus=style_sheets

Full papers must not extend 12 pages (including references). Extended abstracts must not exceed 2 pages (including references).

The timeline for the first submissions (i.e. acceptance for presentation on the workshop) will follow the workshop timeline proposed by GSCL. The timeline for the publication of the special issue of JLCL still needs to be negotiated with the editorial office of JLCL.



The reviewing will be double blind. All submissions should describe original work that has not been previously published. We also accept demos, position papers (opinion pieces), and submissions discussing interesting negative results.

The  Linked Data in Linguistics (LDL) workshop series has become the major forum for presenting, discussing and the application of *Semantic Web standards and the Linked Open Data paradigm to language resources* and will take place again in 2018 in co-location with the 11th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference in Miyazaki, Japan. The LDL workshop series has a general focus on LOD-based language resources, vocabularies, infrastructures and technologies as means for *managing, improving and using language resources on the Web*,  addressing communities as diverse as applied linguistics, lexicography, digital humanities, natural language processing and information technology. LDL provides the primary forum for these communities *to present and to discuss use cases, experiences, best practices, recommendations and technologies* of Linguistic Linked Open Data  in an interdisciplinary setting, addressing topics such as 



(i) *linking language resources*: Linked Data facilitates to the interoperability, re-usability and discoverability of language resources as well as information integration across them.

(ii) *natural language for structured knowledge*: Ontologies and knowledge bases in general are often created with one particular language in mind. Their lexicalization for other natural languages is a prime directive for emerging digital infrastructures in a globalized world.

(iii) *structured knowledge for natural language*: Natural language is in constant development, thus inherently imprecise. Grounding natural language text in structured  knowledge (word sense disambiguation, entity linking, semantic parsing) enables machine readability and processability by downstream tasks.



Moreover, as technology and resources increasingly converge towards a LOD-based ecosystem for the systematic cross-lingual discovery, exploitation, extension, and curation of language resources, we particularly encourage contributions focusing on the development of *research methodologies and applications* building on the Linguistic Linked Open Data Cloud and the existing technology and resource stack: The notion of *Linguistic Data Science* brings together Linguistic Linked Open Data with research questions in linguistics, methods in Natural Language Processing and applications in Digital Humanities. The workshop will also provide the opportunity for the *critical reflection* of Linked Open Data techniques and their application in linguistics, natural language processing and related fields, i.e., to express experiences, challenges, crucial issues, missing aspects regarding the reuse, creation and exploitation of Linguistic Linked Open Data.



Topics of Interest

------------------

We invite presentations of algorithms, methodologies, experiments, use cases, descriptions of research projects and position papers regarding the creation, publication or application of language resources and their linking, as well as descriptions of such data and its uses in research (linguistics, lexicology, Digital Humanities) and technology (natural language processing, lexicography, localization). This includes the following aspects:



(1) Building and managing linked language resources

  - Vocabularies and best practices for language resources and their linking.

  - Application of LOD in language resource infrastructures.

  - Metadata linking and curation for language resources on the Web.



(2) LLOD technology and methodology

  - Methodologies to develop linked language resources on the Web.

  - Using natural language processing to enhance Linked Open Data.

  - Leveraging Linguistic Linked Open Data and Machine Learning.

  - Methods for linking dictionaries across languages.



(3)	LLOD applications

  - Using Linked Open Data to facilitate natural language processing.

  - Using Linked Open Data for quantitative and qualitative linguistic research.

  - Linguistic Linked Open Data for Digital Humanities.

  - Linking language resources and external community resources.

  - Using Linked Open Data to connect lexicographic resources.



(4)	Critical Reflection

  - Challenges of scalability, multilinguality and interoperability in the Web.

  - Legal, social and scientific aspects of Linguistic Linked Open Data.

  - LLOD revisited: Case studies, use cases, and lessons learnt.



We invite both long (8 pages and 2 pages of references, formatted according to the LREC guidelines) and short papers (4 pages and 2 pages of references) representing original research, innovative approaches and resource descriptions. Short papers may also represent project descriptions. These do not have to be implemented but discuss to what extent and for which purposes Linguistic Linked Open Data is reused or created. Projects that are still in their early stages and seek advice from the broader Linguistic Linked Data community are welcome, especially if they include underrepresented fields of study.

Identify, Describe and Share your LRs !

---------------------------------------

Describing your LRs in the LRE Map is now a normal practice in the submission procedure of LREC. To continue the efforts initiated at LREC 2014 about “Sharing LRs” (data, tools, web-services, etc.), authors will have the possibility, when submitting a paper, to upload LRs in a special LREC repository. This effort of sharing LRs, linked to the LRE Map for their description, may become a new regular feature for conferences in our field, thus contributing to creating a common repository where everyone can deposit and share data.



As scientific work requires accurate citations of referenced work so as to allow the community to understand the whole context and also replicate the experiments conducted by other researchers, LREC 2018 endorses the need to uniquely Identify LRs through the use of the International Standard Language Resource Number (ISLRN, www.islrn.org), a Persistent Unique Identifier to be assigned to each Language Resource. The assignment of ISLRNs to LRs cited in LREC papers will be offered at submission time.

Download the MS Word and LaTeX templates here: https://coling2020.org/coling2020.zip

Author Responsibilities:



Papers must be of original, previously-unpublished work. Papers must be anonymized to support double-blind reviewing. If the paper is available as a preprint, this must be indicated on the submission form but not in the paper itself. In addition, COLING’2020 will follow the same policy as ACL'2018 establishing an anonymity period (from June 1st. to author notification) during which non-anonymous posting of preprints is not allowed. Also included in that policy are instructions to reviewers to not rate papers down for not citing recent preprints. Authors are asked to cite published versions of papers instead of preprint versions when possible.



Papers that have been or will be under consideration for other venues at the same time must be declared at submission time. If a paper is accepted for publication at COLING, it must be immediately withdrawn from other venues. If a paper under review at COLING is accepted elsewhere and authors intend to proceed there, the COLING committee must be notified immediately.

All deadlines are 11:59 pm UTC -12h (""anywhere on Earth"").





Submissions



We solicit three categories of papers: regular workshop papers, extended abstracts and cross-submissions. Only regular workshop papers will be included in the proceedings as archival publications, and only regular workshop papers will be eligible for best paper prizes. All three categories of papers may be long (maximum 8 pages plus references) or short (maximum 4 pages plus references). All submissions should be in PDF format and made through the Softconf website set up for this workshop: https://www.softconf.com/acl2021/w15_repl4nlp2021/.



In line with the ACL main conference policy, camera-ready versions of papers will be given one additional page of content, and no limit to additional pages for references.





Regular Workshop Papers



Authors should submit a long paper of up to 8 pages, or a short paper of up to 4 pages, both with unlimited references, following the ACL 2021 formatting requirements (see the ACL 2021 Call For Papers for reference: https://2021.aclweb.org/calls/papers/). The reported research should be substantially original. Accepted papers will be presented as posters. Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information should be included in the papers; self-reference that identifies the authors should be avoided or anonymized. Accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings.



Supplementary Material:



Each submission can be accompanied by a single PDF appendix. The paper submissions need to remain fully self-contained, as these supplementary materials are completely optional, and reviewers are not even asked to review or download them. Supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.





Extended Abstracts



Preliminary but interesting ideas or results that have not been published before may be submitted as extended abstracts. Accepted extended abstracts will be presented as posters, and included in the workshop program and handbook, but will not be included in the workshop proceedings (and are not eligible for best paper prizes).



Extended abstract submissions are therefore ideal for preliminary work which would benefit from exposure but is not ready for publication. Authors should submit a long extended abstract of up to 8 pages, or a short extended abstract of up to 4 pages, both with unlimited references. Submissions should follow the ACL 2021 formatting requirements (see the ACL 2021 Call For Papers for reference: https://2021.aclweb.org/calls/papers/). Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information should be included in the papers; self-reference that identifies the authors should be avoided or anonymized.





Cross-Submissions



In addition to previously unpublished work, we also solicit recent papers on relevant topics that have appeared in a non-NLP venue (e.g., workshop or conference papers at NeurIPS or ICML). Accepted cross-submissions will be presented as posters, with an indication of original venue, but will not be included in the workshop program and handbook, or the workshop proceedings (and are not eligible for best paper prizes). Cross-submissions are ideal for related work which would benefit from exposure to the RepL4NLP audience. Submission length is determined by the original venue. Interested authors should submit their papers in PDF format through the RepL4NLP Softconf website (https://www.softconf.com/acl2021/w15_repl4nlp2021/), with a note on the original venue. Papers in this category do not need to follow the ACL format and selection will be solely determined by the organizing committee.





Best Paper Prizes



To be announced.

Language (iV&L Net)



Special Theme: Image and Video Description



Invited Talks on Image Description, from Computer Vision and NLP 

perspectives:

Pinar Duygulu-Sahin, Bilkent University

Mirella Lapata, University of Edinburgh



1. ENLG 2015

-------------

The ENLG 2015 workshop is the latest in a biennial series of workshops 

on Natural Language Generation (NLG) started in 1987, providing a 

regular forum for presentation of research in this area, both for NLG 

specialists and for researchers from related areas. ENLG is endorsed by 

the ACL Special Interest Group on Generation (SIGGEN). The 2015 edition 

will be held at the University of Brighton, UK, and will be co-organised 

by COST Action IC1307: The European Network on Vision and Language (iV&L 

Net).



As always, ENLG welcomes submissions in all areas of, and approaches to, 

NLG: from specific tasks to complete solutions, and from rule-based to 

statistical and machine learning methods. For this edition, the special 

theme will be Image and Video Description; as well as the usual ENLG 

topics we therefore especially invite submissions in this and related areas.





2. Call for papers and demos

------------------------------

ENLG 2015 invites substantial, original, and unpublished submissions on 

all topics related to natural language generation. Given the special 

theme of ENGL'15, we particularly encourage submissions, in any of the 

three categories (long, short and demo papers), on the automatic 

generation of image and video descriptions. Topics of interest include, 

but are not limited to:



- Content and text planning

- Generation for affect and emotion

- Generation for embodied agents and robots

- Evaluation of NLG systems

- Data-to-text generation

- Lexicalisation

- Multimedia or multimodal generation

- Story-telling and narrative generation

- NLG for real-world applications

- NLG in linguistically motivated frameworks

- Personalization and personality of text

- Psycholinguistics and NLG

- Referring expression generation

- Surface realization

- Machine learning approaches to NLG tasks

- Text-to-text generation and summarisation

- NLG techniques for paraphrase generation

- NLG techniques for abstractive summarisation

- Generation of image and video descriptions



We also invite submissions for system demonstrations. Demo papers should 

describe implemented systems, which will be presented during demo 

sessions throughout the duration of the workshop.





3. Submission and format

-------------------------

ENLG has three submission categories, long and short papers, and demo 

papers:

- Long papers are most appropriate for presenting substantial research 

results and must not exceed eight (8) pages of content, with up to two 

additional pages for references (these will be orally presented);

- Short papers are more appropriate for presenting an ongoing research 

effort and must not exceed four (4) pages, including references (these 

will be presented as posters during the poster session).

- Demo papers should be no more than two pages in length, including 

references, and should describe implemented systems which are of 

relevance to the NLG community. Demo papers will be included in the 

proceedings. Authors of demo papers should be willing to present a demo 

of their system during ENLG 2015.



The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. Submissions 

should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings. Use of the ACL 

style files (available from http://acl2015.org/call_for_papers.html) is 

strongly recommended, and will be required for camera-ready versions. 

Reviewing will be blind, so you should avoid identifying the authors 

within the paper.



Submissions should be uploaded to the Easychair website for the workshop 

(https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=enlg2015).

The International Conference on the Computational Processing of Portuguese

(PROPOR) is the main regular forum for presentation and discussion

of the best research results in the area of natural language and

speech processing focused on the Portuguese language.



The PROPOR series was initiated in 1993 and has since then being held

in Brazil and Portugal. Previous meetings took place in Lisbon (1993),

Curitiba (1996), Porto Alegre (1998), Évora (1999), Atibaia (2000),

Faro (2003), Itatiaia (2006), Curia (2008), Porto Alegre (2010),

Coimbra (2012) and São Carlos (2014).







Call for papers:



We cordially invite anyone researching in any topic of language and

speech processing of Portuguese to submit a paper to PROPOR2016.



Topics of interest include:

• any applied task (e.g. speech recognition, word sense disambiguation,

dialect identification, etc.),

• application (e.g. question answering, subtitling, summarization, etc.),

• basic issue (e.g. parsing, evaluation, etc.),

• subdomain (e.g. phonology, semantics, dialogue, etc.),

• type of resource (e.g. corpora, ontologies, grammars, etc.),

• linguistic phenomenon (e.g. prosody, anaphora, modality, etc.),

• in any area benefiting from language and speech processing of Portuguese

(e.g. information retrieval, e-learning, e-humanities, etc.),

• under any methodological perspective (e.g. hybrid, symbolic,

machine learning, etc.),

• from the industry or

• from any contributing academic discipline, including but not limited

to Computation, Artificial Intelligence, Engineering, Linguistics

or Cognitive Science.



We seek to select papers reporting substantial, original and completed

work, especially those that may contribute in a significant way to

the advancement of the area. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation

results should be included. Submissions are anonymized and will be

evaluated by at least three reviewers.



The proceedings of PROPOR2016 will be published at Springer as a volume

of the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence Series. They will be

available online, and the paper version will be distributed among

participants of the conference.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTIONS



We invite submissions which describe architecture, design, implementation, or experiments with existing systems which use semantic technologies. Preliminary reports describing research prototypes are welcome, too. The papers should explain how the use of semantic technologies helps to solve specific problems and/or is beneficial for the users. The authors will be given an opportunity to demonstrate their system during the poster and demo session at the conference.

POSTERS AND POSITION PAPERS



In addition to oral paper presentations KESW 2016 encourages other forms of contributing to the conference, in particular, posters and position papers.



Posters is an opportunity to informally present your research approach and results during the poster session of the conference. It is great for discussing your research in free form with all attendants of the session. Lots of people will be stopping by your poster and you will have a chance to talk to them, explain what you are doing, and get feedback. Of course, the number of people who will stop depends on how well you design your poster!



Position papers are means of presenting preliminary research ideas or proposals. They are particularly suitable for early stage PhD students who would like to discuss their ideas and get feedback before they go deep developing them.



Submissions for both categories need to be 2 page abstracts describing the method and the results (for posters) or the preliminary ideas (position papers). Selected poster and position paper submissions will be allocated a short 5 minute talk slots during the conference.

SUBMISSION



All authors will be required to pre-submit abstracts of their papers. Both papers and abstracts should be submitted via EasyChair.



Size restrictions



    Research, industry, and educational tracks: 15 pages including references.

    System description papers: 10 pages including references.

    Posters and position papers: 2 page abstract.



We strongly encourage all authors to prepare their submissions according to the Springer LNCS format. This will be strictly enforced for all accepted papers. Contact Axel Ngonga (PC Chair) if this becomes a show stopper.



IMPORTANT DATES



All deadlines are for the Hawaii time zone.

Recent examples include sudden or unexpected events such as terrorist attacks, political shake-ups such as Brexit as well as longer ongoing and evolving topics such as the migration crisis in Europe that regularly spawn events of global importance affecting local communities. These developments result in a vast amount of event-centric, multilingual information available from heterogeneously sources on the Web, in the Web of Data, within Knowledge Graphs, in social media, inside Web archives and in the news sources. Such event-centric information differs across sources, languages and communities, potentially reflecting community-specific aspects, opinions, sentiments and bias.



The goal of the interdisciplinary CLEOPATRA workshop is bringing together researchers and practitioners from the fields of Semantic Web, the Web, NLP, IR, Human Computation, Visual Analytics and Digital Humanities to discuss and evaluate methods and solutions for effective and efficient analytics of event-centric multilingual information spread across heterogeneous sources to deliver analytical results in the way meaningful to the users, helping the users to cross the language barrier and better understand event representations in other languages and their context.



We are interested in approaches for extracting, validating, contextualizing and interlinking of event-related information. We aim to discuss technologies addressing the use of knowledge graphs in conjunction with NLP methods and visual analytics aiming to analyse event-centric information in multiple languages as well as developing novel methods for user interaction with multilingual information. We want to facilitate a discussion around how to facilitate event-centric cross-lingual analytics and cross-cultural studies.

The Challenge is open to everyone from industry and academia.



RATIONALE

Mining opinions and sentiments from natural language, however, is an extremely difficult task as it involves a deep understanding of most of the explicit and implicit, regular and irregular, syntactical and semantic rules proper of a language. Existing approaches mainly rely on parts of text in which opinions and sentiments are explicitly expressed such as polarity terms, affect words and their co-occurrence frequencies. However, opinions and sentiments are often conveyed implicitly through latent semantics, which make purely syntactical approaches ineffective. To this end, concept-level sentiment analysis aims to go beyond a mere word-level analysis of text and provide novel approaches to opinion mining and sentiment analysis that allow a more efficient passage from (unstructured) textual information to (structured) machine-processable data, in potentially any domain.



Concept-level sentiment analysis focuses on a semantic analysis of text through the use of web ontologies or semantic networks, which allow the aggregation of conceptual and affective information associated with natural language opinions. By relying on large semantic knowledge bases, concept- level sentiment analysis steps away from blind use of keywords and word co- occurrence count, but rather relies on the implicit features associated with natural language concepts. Unlike purely syntactical techniques, concept- based approaches are able to detect also sentiments that are expressed in a subtle manner, e.g., through the analysis of concepts that do not explicitly convey any emotion, but which are implicitly linked to other concepts that do so.



The Challenge focuses on the introduction, presentation, and discussion of novel approaches to concept-level sentiment analysis. Participants will have to design a concept-level opinion-mining engine that exploits common-sense knowledge bases, e.g., SenticNet, and/or Linked Data and Semantic Web ontologies, e.g., DBPedia, to perform multi-domain sentiment analysis. The main motivation for the Challenge, in particular, is to go beyond a mere word-level analysis of natural language text and provide novel concept-level tools and techniques that allow a more efficient passage from (unstructured) natural language to (structured) machine-processable data, in potentially any domain.



Systems must have a semantics flavor (e.g., by making use of Linked Data or known semantic networks within their core functionalities) and authors need to show how the introduction of semantics can be used to obtain valuable information, functionality or performance. Existing natural language processing methods or statistical approaches can be used too as long as the semantics plays a main role within the core approach (engines based merely on syntax/word-count will be excluded from the competition).



TASKS

The Concept-Level Sentiment Analysis Challenge is defined in terms of different tasks. The first task is elementary whereas the others are more advanced. The input units of each task are sentences. Sentences are assumed to be in grammatically correct American English and have to be processed according to the input format specified at http://sentic.net/challenge/sentence.



Elementary Task: Polarity Detection

The main goal of the Challenge is polarity detection. The proposed systems will be assessed according to precision, recall and F-measure of detected binary polarity values (1=positive; 0=negative) for each input sentence of the evaluation dataset, following the same format asinhttp://sentic.net/challenge/task0. The problem of subjectivity detection is not addressed within this Challenge, hence participants can assume that there will be no neutral sentences. Participants are encouraged to use the Sentic API or further develop and apply sentic computing tools.



Advanced Task #1: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis

The output of this task will be a set of aspects of the reviewed product and a binary polarity value associated to each of such aspects, in the format specified at http://sentic.net/challenge/task1. So, for example, while for the Elementary Task an overall polarity (positive or negative) is expected for a review about a mobile phone, this task requires a set of aspects (such as ‘speaker’, ‘touchscreen’, ‘camera’, etc.) and a polarity value (positive OR negative) associated with each of such aspects. Systems will be assessed according to both aspect extraction and aspect polarity detection.



Advanced Task #2: Semantic Parsing

As suggested by the title, the Challenge focuses on sentiment analysis at concept-level. This means that the proposed systems are not supposed to work at word/syntax level but rather work with concepts/semantics. Hence, this task will evaluate the capability of the proposed systems to deconstruct natural language text into concepts, following the same format as in http://sentic.net/challenge/task2. SenticNet will be taken as a reference to test the efficiency of the proposed parsers, but extracted concepts won't necessary have to match SenticNet concepts. The proposed systems, for example, are supposed to be able to extract a multi-word expression like ‘buy christmas present’ from sentences such as “Today I bought a lot of very nice Christmas presents’. The number of extracted concepts per sentence will be assessed through precision, recall and F-measure against the evaluation dataset.



Advanced Task #3: Topic Spotting

Input sentences will be about four different domains, namely: books, DVDs, electronics, and kitchen appliances. This task focuses on the automatic classification of sentences into one of such domains, in the format specified at http://sentic.net/challenge/task3. All sentences are assumed to belong to only one of the above-mentioned domains. The proposed systems are supposed to exploit the extracted concepts to infer which domain each sentence belongs to. Classification accuracy will be evaluated in terms of precision, recall and F-measure against the evaluation dataset.



EVALUATION

Systems will be evaluated against a testing dataset which will be revealed and released after the first-round of evaluation during the Conference. Participants are suggested to train and/or test their own systems using the Blitzer Dataset. The testing dataset will be constructed in the same way and from the same sources as the Blitzer dataset.



The evaluation will be performed by the members of the Program Committee. For systems that can be tuned with different parameters, please indicate a range of up to 4 sets of settings. Settings with the best F-measures will be considered for judgment. For each system, reviewers will give a numerical score within the range [1-10] and details motivating their choice. The scores will be given to the following aspects:

1. Use of common-sense knowledge and semantics;

2. Precision, recall, and F-measure wrt the selected task;

3. Computational time;

4. Innovative nature of the approach.



JUDGING AND PRIZES

After a first round of review, the Program Committee and the chairs will select a number of submissions confirming to the challenge requirements that will be invited to present their work. Submissions accepted for presentation will be included in post-proceedings and will receive constructive reviews from the Program Committee. All accepted submissions will have a slot in a poster session dedicated to the challenge. In addition, the winners will present their work in a special slot of the main program of ESWC and will be invited to submit a paper to a dedicated Semantic Web Journal special issue.



For the Concept-Level Sentiment Analysis Challenge there will be two awards for each task:

- Quantitative: the system with the highest average score in items 1-3 above;

- Innovative: the system with the highest score in item 4 above.

There will be a board of judges at the conference who will evaluate again the systems in more detail. The judges will then meet in private to discuss the entries and to determine the winners. It may happen that the same system runs for both the awards. An amount of €700 has already been secured for the first task, for what the first point of the evaluation aspects is concerned. We are currently working on securing further funding.



HOW TO PARTICIPATE

The following information has to be provided via EasyChair:

- Abstract: no more than 200 words.

- Description: It should contain the details of the system, including why the system is innovative, how it uses Semantic Web, which features or functions the system provides, what design choices were made and what lessons were learned. The description should also summarize how participants have addressed the evaluation tasks. Papers must be submitted in PDF format, following the style of the Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, and not exceeding 5 pages in length.

- Web Access: The application can either be accessible via the web or downloadable. If the application is not publicly accessible, password must be provided. A short set of instructions on how to use the application should be provided as well.

Cognitive Computation (impact factor: 4.287)

BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION

With the recent development of deep learning, research in artificial intelligence (AI) has gained new vigor and prominence. Machine learning, however, suffers from three big issues, namely:

1. Dependency: it requires (a lot of) training data and is domain-dependent;

2. Consistency: different training or tweaking leads to different results;

3. Transparency: the reasoning process is uninterpretable (black-box algorithms).



Sentic computing addresses such issues in the context of natural language processing (NLP) through a multi-disciplinary approach that aims to bridge the gap between statistical NLP and many other disciplines that are necessary for understanding human language, such as linguistics, commonsense reasoning, and affective computing. Sentic computing, whose term derives from the Latin sensus (as in commonsense) and sentire (root of words such as sentiment and sentience), enables the analysis of text not only at document, page or paragraph level, but also at sentence, clause, and concept level.



This is possible thanks to the fact that sentic computing is both top-down and bottom-up: topdown for the fact that it leverages symbolic models such as semantic networks and conceptual dependency representations to encode meaning; bottom-up because it uses sub-symbolic methods such as deep neural networks and multiple kernel learning to infer syntactic patterns from data. Coupling symbolic and sub-symbolic AI is key for stepping forward in the path from NLP to natural language understanding. Relying solely on machine learning, in fact, is simply useful to make a ’good guess’ based on past experience, because sub-symbolic methods only encode correlation and their decision-making process is merely probabilistic. Natural language understanding, however, requires much more than that. To use Noam Chomsky’s words, ""you do not get discoveries in the sciences by taking huge amounts of data, throwing them into a computer and doing statistical analysis of them: that’s not the way you understand things, you have to have theoretical insights"".



In the past ten years, sentic computing positioned itself as a horizontal technology that served as a back-end to many different applications in the areas of e-business, e-commerce, e-health, e-governance, e-security, e-learning, e-tourism, e-mobility, e-entertainment, and more. Some examples of such applications include financial forecasting and healthcare quality assessment, community detection and social media marketing, human communication comprehension and dialogue systems. In this light, this Special Issue focuses on the introduction, presentation, and discussion of novel approaches that further develop and apply sentic computing models (e.g., the Hourglass of Emotions or Sentic Patterns), algorithms (e.g., Sentic LDA or Sentic LSTM), and resources (e.g., SenticNet or AffectiveSpace) for the design of emotion-sensitive applications. Articles are thus invited in areas such as natural language processing, information retrieval, data mining, pattern recognition, knowledge-based systems, novel neural and cognitive models. Topics include, but are not limited to:



• Sentic Computing for Human-Computer Interaction

- dialogue systems

- multimodal interaction

- affective robots



• Sentic Computing for Business Intelligence

- social media marketing

- recommendation systems

- customer experience management



• Sentic Computing for Finance

- market trend prediction

- portfolio management

- asset allocation



• Sentic Computing for Healthcare

- outbreak management

- patient-reported outcome measures

- mental disorder detection



• Sentic Computing for Social Media Monitoring

- cyber issue detection

- political forecasting

- public opinion mining



• Sentic Computing for Social Good

- sexual harassment detection

- discrimination prevention

- suicidal ideation detection



• Sentic Computing for the Arts

- emotion visualization

- ethnography

- emotional design in digital media



The Special Issue also welcomes papers on specific application domains of sentic computing. To be considered, authors will need to clearly establish relevance of their paper to the scope of the Special Issue and the journal. The authors will be required to submit their papers at http://www.editorialmanager.com/cogn (select the option “S.I.: A Decade of Sentic Computing” at the end of the submission process) and follow the Author’s Guide for manuscript submission to Cognitive Computation. No extensions will be granted.



COMPOSITION AND REVIEW PROCEDURES

The Special Issue will consist of papers on novel methods and techniques that further develop and apply sentic computing tools for the development of emotion-sensitive tools, techniques, or applications. Some papers may survey various aspects of the topic. The balance between these will be adjusted to maximize the issue’s impact. All articles are expected to successfully negotiate the standard review procedures for Cognitive Computation.

"1624353301-875","http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=natural%20language%20processing&page=13","DiLiTAL 2017","http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=62583&copyownerid=37362","Knowing how to communicate is one of the founding principles of every society. Our lives along with our existence are inextricably related to our ability to mutually understand each other. However, this situation may well be construed as an insuperable problem due to our culture and linguistic difference as well as our life experiences, viewpoints, etc. Replete are the countries where people practice many languages no matter how different their statuses are, a situation which yields an important disparity between languages at the level of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and resources. Languages with a lower status are commonly dubbed “Poorly Endowed Languages” (PEL). More often than not, the NLP scientific work exhibits little interest in these languages, which may well be construed as an incontestable handicap, especially within the predominating globalizing context.



Well aware of this situation, this workshop is looking forward to setting up the ground for a reflection whose central thrust is to endorse and enlarge NLP work to a whole range of languages other than the putatively well-treated languages. The main goal meant to be achieved in this workshop is to introduce linguistic and cultural diversity along a line of thinking that focuses on the creation of resources and tools as well as meet the PEL specialists training needs. This demarche, thereby, falls under the various initiatives set up by big international organizations (United Nations, Europe Council, etc.) with an eye to meeting the aforementioned objective.



The need to automatically process PELs derives much of its appeal and utility from scientific and humanitarian (health, education, culture and communication) needs. Stakes may further extend to political needs (access to information and learning). In fine accord with a number of PEL-interested-researchers common line of thinking, DiLiTAL’s central goal is to sensitize scientific community of the stakes and obstacles besetting the processing of such languages. We would like to unravel the main difficulties with an eye to broaching an epistemological reflection on the generic capacity of tools and resources, which will make the processing of a huge number of languages possible. Another objective meant to be achieved is to identify PEL specific needs based on their specificity and typology. From the foregoing, it emerges that this enterprise aims at shedding light on the various methods and techniques deployed so as to inject some dynamism into the construction and sharing of resources and to ease knowledge and know-how transfer.



DiLiTAL workshop will focus on the following points: 

I.Resources and corpus: production, standardization and archiving

Under this point, we would like to unravel the current and future efforts invested in collecting and structuring both specialized and general PEL language data. These data (lexicons, corpora, etc.) are, more often than not, made avail of in the training of morpho-syntactic taggers. This training is, in turn, viewed as a preliminary stage for undertaking more complex tasks, such as the accessibility and portability of linguistic data, phenomena that happen to be insuperable problems in the works on PEL. From the foregoing, it emerges that participants’ contribution to open source creation is particularly appreciated and welcome.

II.PEL processing tools

We will also try to accommodate the pertinence of PEL existing tools, and how these tools get around multilingualism. In fact, NLP, ever since the emergence of UTF-8 (Unicode), has developed the ability to diversify its field of action research, making the processing of PEL possible. Along this line of thinking, we intend to invest more effort on improving the management of multilingualism management by including new graphics and standards, while identifying methodological constraints that baffle researchers who work on PEL with the existing tools.

III. Social, cultural and ethical questions

DiLiTAL will also be an opportunity to think of the possibilities of cross-border cooperation with an eye to encouraging experience exchange and injecting some dynamism in NLP research in countries where PELs are attested. It is also our goal in this workshop to address the ethical dimension of collecting, archiving and processing linguistic data, which are anchored in a whole range of social contexts. Importantly, the codes and customs of these social contexts are unknown or are at odds with the codes and traditions of researchers. Of prime importance among our goals is also to reflect on a field methodology whose central objective is not only to serve science but also to account for citizens, who identify themselves to the language that they speak, and to the sociocultural context where they live. This workshop will further be an opportunity to discuss how NLP could be viewed as an engine that brings about linguistic change. 

IV. Return of experience

Any contribution that gives a handle on experiences of PEL processing is welcome and appreciated. The synthesis reached by researchers having worked on this sort of problems will enable us to enrich the epistemological reflection necessary for the setting up of tools, and will also help us overcome the framework of one particular sort of languages. These experiences may well be construed to be of prime utility for identifying the fields to which research on NLP may contribute. No matter what language we speak of, a return of experience is of paramount importance in identifying the approaches convergences and divergences. With the above as background, any work on return of experience will, thereby, contribute in enriching this workshop and the action research that follows.



Topics addressed:

 - PEL Tools and resources: implementation and evaluation;

 - Writing systems and multilingualism management;

 - Methodology (roadmap) for PEL digitalization;

 - Neology treatment;

 - NLP for the normalization and codification of PELs;

 - etc."

For example, PubMed has over 20 million documents, 10 million unique names and 70 million name mentions. Google Scholar has many millions more, it is believed. These rapidly-growing online documents offer several benefits for discovery, learning, and staying informed. However, data mining applications are now faced with the challenge of efficiently processing more documents in less time.

Understanding how at scale research topics emerge, evolve, or disappear, what is a good measure of quality of published works, what are the most promising areas of research, how authors connect and influence each other, who are the experts in a field, and who funds a particular research topic are some of the major foci of the rapidly emerging field of Scholarly Big Data. More recently, social web style metrics for measuring the impact of scholarly work for example, Altametrics were formulated. Academic social networks such as academia.edu and researchgate are also being developed to systematically enable collaboration and discovery on the scientific web. In addition to citation and co-authorship networks based on scholarly manuscripts, newer forms of scholarly communications are now possible via interfaces such as Twitter and Facebook groups. How useful are these novel networking abilities for scholarly communications? Can we detect topical flows, influential ideas, and citation and collaboration patterns based on interactions on these platforms? Can activities on these platforms serve as substitutes for assessing scholarly impact before citations are accumulated? These novel questions form an important theme in our proposed workshop."

Nowadays, social platforms have become the most popular communication system all over the world. In fact, due to the short format of messages and the accessibility of these systems, users tend to shift from traditional communication tools (such as blogs, web sites and mailing lists) to social network for various purposes. Billions of messages are appearing daily in these services such as Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, etc. The authors of these messages share content about their private life, exchanging opinions on a variety of topics and discussing a wide range of information news. 



--objective-- 



In light of this, the number of active users is estimated to 1 billion worldwide, which makes these systems the fastest- growing web sites in the world. Even if these system cannot represent an alternative to the authoritative information media, considering the number of its users and the impressive response time of their contributions, they represent a sort of real-time news sensor that can also predate the best newspapers in informing the web community about the emerging topics and trends. In fact, the most important information media always need a certain amount of time to react to a news event; i.e. professional journalists require time, collaborators and/or technology support to provide a professional report. However a user can easily report, in few characters, what is happening in front of the user’s eyes, without any concern about the readers or the writing style. These aspects make social services the most powerful sensor for events detection and automatic news generation. The aim of this workshop is to ask researchers to enter into such view, by studying how Social platforms can be used in a real-time scenario to detect emerging events and enrich them with contextual information like categorization, named entities and relationships with other events and sources of information. 





The call for papers will assume the form of a call for surveys and ideas, to motivate researchers to present their view on the current state of the art and the future research challenges. Authors will be thus asked to submit a paper

describing the following points:



1. State of the art survey on the recent literature which can be interpreted as a social-sensor study or analysis

2. Existing research challenges which can be considered as emerging, or completely new challenges that can be proposed in future

research, with their impact on the community

3. A proposed set of features, models, techniques that can be adopted, and the expected results



Papers will be qualitatively evaluated as in a usual reviewing process, but with a particular focus on the clarity of the proposed

survey and the identified research challenges. At conference time, authors will be invited to present their works, and briefly introduce their points of view on the social-sensor current research. Then, an open discussion panel will follow, aiming at fostering new ideas through face to face interactions.

• Social Media as Social Sensors

• Social Media Analytics and Social Network Analysis

• Topics, Trends and Community Extraction

• Social-sensor Ontologies

• Big Data and Social Media

• Cultural Analysis of Social Media

http://gtweb.uit.no/iwclul2017



23–24th January, 2017, St. Petersburg, Russia



  Call for papers



   The purpose of the conference series International Workshop on Computational

   Linguistics for Uralic Languages is to bring together researchers

   working on computational approaches to working with these languages.

   We accept long and short papers as well as tutorial proposals working on the following

   languages: Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian, Võro, the Sámi languages,

   Komi (Zyrian, Permyak), Mordvin (Erzya, Moksha), Mari (Hill, Meadow),

   Udmurt, Nenets (Tundra, Forest), Enets, Nganasan, Selkup, Mansi,

   Khanty, Veps, Karelian (Olonets), Karelian, Ingrian (Izhorian),

   Votic, Livonian, Ludic, and other related languages.



   All Uralic languages exhibit rich morphological structure, which

   makes processing them challenging for state-of-the-art computational

   linguistic approaches, the majority also suffer from a lack of

   resources and many are endangered.



   Research papers should be original, substantial and unpublished

   research, that can describe work-in-progress systems, frameworks,

   standards and evaluation schemes. Demos and tutorials will present

   systems and standards towards the goal of interoperability and

   unification of different projects, applications and research groups .

   Appropriate topics include (but are not limited to):

     * Parsers, analysers and processing pipelines of Uralic languages

     * Lexical databases, electronic dictionaries

     * Finished end-user applications aimed at Uralic languages, such as

       spelling or grammar checkers, machine translation or speech

       processing

     * Evaluation methods and gold standards, tagged corpora, treebanks

     * Reports on language-independent or unsupervised methods as applied to Uralic languages

     * Surveys and review articles on subjects related to computational linguistics for one or more Uralic languages

     * Any work that aims at combining efforts and reducing duplication of work

     * How to elicit activity from the language community, agitation campaigns, games with a purpose



   To maximise the possibility of reproducibility, replication and

   reuse, we particularly encourage submissions which present

   free/open-source language resources and make use of free/open-source

   software.



   One of the aims of this gathering is to avoid unnecessary duplicated

   work in field of Uralistics by establishing connections and

   interoperability standards between researchers and research groups

   working at different sites. We have also identified a serious lack of

   gold standards and evaluation metrics for all Uralic languages

   including those with national support, any work towards better

   resources in these fields will be greatly appreciated. In this year's

   edition we particularly encourage researchers of minority Uralic languages

   in Russia to participate."

# SHARED TASK: EXPLANATION REGENERATION



We are excited to announce a shared task on Explanation Regeneration! The resulting papers will be peer-reviewed by participating teams, and accepted system descriptions will be presented along with the main workshop papers. 



Multi-hop inference is the task of combining more than one piece of information to solve an inference task, such as question answering. The shared task on Explanation Regeneration asks participants to develop methods to reconstruct gold explanations for elementary science questions, using a new corpus of gold explanations that provides supervision and instrumentation for this multi-hop inference task. 



This shared task focuses on explanation reconstruction, a stepping-stone towards general multi-hop inference over language. In particular, the inputs to this task consist of questions and their correct answers. Participating systems must extract and rank explanation sentences from a provided structured knowledge base such that the top-ranked sentences provide a complete explanation for the given answer.



## Example



For example, for the question: ""Which of the following is an example of an organism taking in nutrients?"" with the correct answer: ""a girl eating an apple"", an ideal system would rank the following explanatory statements at the top of its extracted sentences:



1. A girl means a human girl.

2. Humans are living organisms.

3. Eating is when an organism takes in nutrients in the form of food.

4. Fruits are kinds of foods.

5. An apple is a kind of fruit.



The data used in this shared task contains 1,680 questions, together with explanation sentences for their correct answers (Jansen et al., 2018).



The knowledge base supporting these questions contains approximately 5,000 facts.



Please see the shared task website for more details: https://github.com/umanlp/tg2019task

ToRPorEsp: Workshop on Tools and Resources for Automatically

Processing Portuguese and Spanish (Propor 2014)



October, 5th, 2014

Sao Carlos (SP), Brazil



https://sites.google.com/site/torporesp





Deadline for Abstract Submissions: July, 15th, 2014 (11:59pm GMT -12)



 



Much of the research and development of NLP tools has been done for

English, leading to best state of the art systems for this language,

while other languages lack of the coverage of English resources.

Although there are several interesting initiatives to develop state of

the art tools for other languages, there may not be enough awareness

in the community about them and the same work may be repeated in

several institutions and projects. This is a limitation for new

projects or research that would benefit from having such tools

available to develop higher level systems. Similarly, work done for

one language may be beneficial to other closely related languages.

Within this context, we present the first Ã^Â Workshop on Tools and

Resources for Automatically Processing Portuguese and Spanish in

PROPOR 2014 (International Conference on Computational Processing

of Portuguese, http://nilc.icmc.usp.br/propor2014/).



This workshop aims to be a forum for the presentation and discussion

of language-specific developments for Portuguese and Spanish, two

closely related languages. We expect to join together researchers

and developers with a focus on the creation of tools and linguistic

resources for these two languages. These are two thriving communities

that can join efforts to maximize the impact of the developments in

the area for each of these languages, and promote resource reuse and

sharing. This workshop offers a venue for researchers and developers

to show work in NLP tools and resources, covering a wide spectrum of

tasks (from PoS taggers and parsers to text simplification or

sentiment analysis tools), and linguistic resources (WordNet

initiatives, grammars, etc). Furthermore, given the proximity of these

two languages, this workshop aims to promote discussion of

crosslinguistic approaches and possible tuning of existing tools for

one language as basis for developing similar tools for the other.





A special interest of the workshop is to facilitate access to

technologies and resources that are specific to Portuguese and

Spanish. We intend that the workshop will contribute to make tools and

resources easily available to the local community. To that aim, we

encourage submissions that are oriented towards simplifying the

integration of a given tool or resource to address specific needs in

these regions. Detailed descriptions, motivation of utility with

specific scenarios, even tutorial-like approaches will be highly

appreciated. All workshop-related materials will be readily available

from the workshop webpage, to promote adoption.





The workshop is targeted at anyone interested on developing and using  

tools and resources for Portuguese and Spanish. Presentations and  

demonstrations are invited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

* NLP tools: PoS taggers, parsers, etc

* NLP applications: text simplification, summarization, sentiment  

analysis, information retrieval, etc

* Linguistic Resources: WordNet, grammars, etc

* Techniques to Automatically create such resources

* Techniques to Automatically adapt such resources to local variants  

of the languages.

* Cross-lingual approches, between Portuguese and Spanish or other languages.





Submssions

-------------------------

The main goal of this workshop is to offer a venue for sharing tools

and resources . Thus we encourage submissions of presentations and

demonstrations of both consolidated and under-development resources.



Authors are invited to submit their presentations/demonstrations in

the form of abstracts that will be published online. We accept

submissions in English, Portuguese and Spanish. Abstracts should

contain authors names, afiliations, a set of keywords and should be up

to four pages including references. Papers must be submitted in PDF,

following the Springer LNAI format guidelines.

Workshop: Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA)

3rd UIMA@GSCL Workshop



extended submission deadline: July, 19



September 23, 2013

Darmstadt, Germany

in conjunction with GSCL 2013: http://gscl2013.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/



Further Information:

http://bit.ly/123EYSv





====================================================





In recent years, the Unstructured Information Management Architecture 

(UIMA) framework has been proposed as a middleware platform which 

offers integration by design through common type systems and

standardized communication methods for components analysing streams

of unstructured information, such as natural language. The UIMA

framework offers a solid processing infrastructure that allows

developers to concentrate on the implementation of the actual

analytics components. An increasing number of members of the NLP

community thus have adopted UIMA as a platform facilitating the

creation of reusable NLP components that can be assembled to address

different NLP tasks depending on their order, combination and

configuration.



This workshop aims at bringing together the NLP community -- users,

developers or providers of either UIMA components or UIMA-related

tools in order to explore and discuss the opportunities and 

challenges in using UIMA as a platform for modern, well-engineered

NLP. Alternatives to and comparisons of other frameworks (such as

GATE, LingPipe, etc) with UIMA are of interest, too.



Workshop topics include, but are not limited to:

- processing of very large data collections: scale-out, 

  parallelization, and performance optimization

- advanced applications driven by UIMA

- sophisticated tools to build and manage complex processing 

  pipelines

- analysis of results: exploration, evaluation, visualization, and 

  statistical analysis

- experience reports combining UIMA-based components from different 

  sources, as well as solutions to interoperability issues

- UIMA components with a special focus on genericity and type-system 

  independence

- repositories of ready-to-use UIMA-based components

- (generic) type systems for UIMA

- distribution of UIMA components: documentation, licensing and 

  packaging

- developing for UIMA: simplified APIs, debugging, unit testing, and 

  limitations of UIMA

International Conference on Asian Language Processing 2014 (IALP2014)

20-22 October 2014, Kuching, Borneo Malaysia

http://ialp2014.colips.org/

Paper Submission Deadline is extended to 31 May 2014.

 

The International Conference on Asian Language Processing (IALP) is a series of conferences with unique focus on Asian Language Processing. The conference aims to advance the science and technology of all the aspects of Asian Language Processing by providing a forum for researchers in the different fields of language study all over the world to meet. The first meeting of the series was held in Singapore in 1986 and was called the ""International Conference on Chinese Computing (ICCC)"" then. This meeting initiated the study of Chinese and oriental languages processing in Singapore and resulted in the formation of COLIPS in Singapore in 1988, as well as the publication of the journal ""Communications of COLIPS"" in 1991, which is known as ""International Journal on Asian Language Processing"" today. Over the years, IALP has developed into one of important annual events on natural language processing in Asia.

 

This year, the International Conference on Asian Language Processing 2014 (IALP 2014) will be jointly organized by the Institute of Social Informatics and Technological Innovations (ISITI) and Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS), and Chinese and Oriental Languages Information Processing Society (COLIPS). The conference will be held at Hilton Kuching Hotel, Kuching, Sarawak, Borneo Malaysia on the 20-22 October, 2014. We will continue to work with IEEE to publish the conference proceedings, which will be submitted to the IEEE Xplore digital library and submitted for indexing in INSPEC, EI, ISTP/ISI and Current Contents on Diskette.

 

Kuching is the capital of Sarawak, the largest East Malaysian state, on the island of Borneo. In itself is a microcosm of cultures: 2.4 million people forming the 28 ethnic groups, each with its own culture and language. The city illuminates a mix of new and old architectures dating back to the White Rajahs. The local host of this conference, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS), is located 40 minute drive from Kuching. It is internationally recognised for providing indigenous technologies to communities in Borneo and beyond.

 Semantic Web Journal

 Special Issue on Question Answering over Linked Data

------------------------------------------------------





The importance of the Semantic Web as a knowledge source is rapidly increasing. It is also gaining significant industrial relevance amongst content providers and search engine vendors. However, although the amount of linked data is growing, it is still used mostly by Semantic Web experts. One of the main reasons is that accessing the billions of RDF triples already available requires proficiency in the query language SPARQL as well as familiarity with the datasets available and their underlying schemas. These obstacles leave much of the available semantic knowledge inaccessible for most humans, which in turn diminishes the opportunities for its exploitation.



As a result, there is a growing amount of research on interaction paradigms that allow end users to access linked data and hide the complexity of Semantic Web standards behind an easy-to-use interface. Especially question answering systems play a major role, as they allow users to express arbitrarily complex information needs in an intuitive fashion and, at least in principle, in their native language.



The key challenge in providing end users with multilingual access to structured, linked data lies in interpreting the user's information need expressed in natural language with respect to the data that is queried. This involves challenges different from question answering over free text. In particular it requires dealing with the gap between natural language and data models, with distributed, heterogeneous datasets, and the use of background information and reasoning.



We solicit original papers addressing the challenges involved in question answering over linked data, presenting resources and tools to support question answering over linked data, or describing question answering systems and applications.





Particular topics of interest include (but are not restricted to):

------------------------------------------------------------------



* Natural language analysis

* Term matching and entity disambiguation

* Language resources for question answering (data as well as open-source software)

* SPARQL query generation

* Discovery of semantic sources

* Dealing with data and schema heterogeneity

* Dealing with incompleteness and inconsistencies

* Answer aggregation

* Answer rendering

* Providing justifications of answers and conveying trust

* User feedback and interaction

* Scalability and indexing of large datasets

* Knowledge base design for question answering

* Reasoning for question answering

* Keyword-based approaches

All submissions should be in PDF format.



Double-Blind Reviewing:

Anonymity Requirements for Double-Blind Reviewing:

Every research paper submitted to NLPCC-ICCPOL 2016 will undergo a ""double-blind"" reviewing process: the PC members and referees who review the paper will not know the identity of the authors. To ensure anonymity of authorship, authors must prepare their manuscript as follows:

1. Authors' names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.

2. Funding sources must not be acknowledged on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.

3. Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper.

4. The paper's file name must not identify the authors of the paper. It is strongly suggested that the submitted file be named with the assigned submission number.

5. You must also use care when referring to related previous work, particularly your own work, in the paper. For example, if you are Jane Smith, the following text gives away the authorship of the submitted paper:

In our previous work [1,2], we presented two algorithms for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ...

Bibliography

[1] Jane Smith, ""A Simple Algorithm for ...,"" Proceedings of ACL 2007, pp. 1-8.

[2] Jane Smith, ""A More Complicated Algorithm for ...,"" Proceedings of ACL 2008, pp.33-40.

The solution is to reference your past work in the third person (just as you would any other piece of work that is related to the submitted paper). This allows you to set the context for the submitted paper, while at the same time preserving anonymity:

In previous work [1,2], algorithms were presented for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ...

Bibliography

[1] Jane Smith, ""A Simple Algorithm for ...,"" Proceedings of ACL 2007, pp. 1-8.

[2] Jane Smith, ""A More Complicated Algorithm for ...,"" Proceedings of ACL 2008, pp.33-40.

It is the responsibility of authors to do their very best to preserve anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to rejection without review.

---------------------------------------------------------------



The human ability to acquire and process language has long attracted interest and generated much debate due to the apparent ease with which such a complex and dynamic system is learnt and used on the face of ambiguity, noise and uncertainty. This subject raises many questions ranging from the nature vs. nurture debate of how much needs to be innate and how much needs to be learned for acquisition to be successful, to the mechanisms involved in this process (general vs specific) and their representations in the human brain. There are also developmental issues related to the different stages consistently found during acquisition (e.g. one word vs. two words) and possible organizations of this knowledge. These have been discussed in the context of first and second language acquisition and bilingualism, with crosslinguistic studies shedding light on the influence of the language and the environment.

 

The past decades have seen a massive expansion in the application of statistical and machine learning methods to natural language processing (NLP). This work has yielded impressive results in numerous speech and language processing tasks, including e.g. speech recognition, morphological analysis, parsing, lexical acquisition, semantic interpretation, and dialogue management. The good results have generally been viewed as engineering achievements. Recently researchers have begun to investigate the relevance of computational learning methods for research on human language acquisition and change.

The use of computational modeling is a relatively recent trend boosted by advances in machine learning techniques, and the availability of resources like corpora of child and child-directed sentences, and data from psycholinguistic tasks by normal and pathological groups. Many of the existing computational models attempt to study language tasks under cognitively plausible criteria (such as memory and processing limitations that humans face), and to explain the developmental stages observed in the acquisition and evolution of the language abilities. In doing so, computational modeling provides insight into the plausible mechanisms involved in human language processes, and inspires the development of better language models and techniques. These investigations are very important since if computational techniques can be used to improve our understanding of human language acquisition and change, these will not only benefit cognitive sciences in general but will reflect back to NLP and place us in a better position to develop useful language models.

 

Success in this type of research requires close collaboration between the NLP, linguistics, psychology and cognitive science communities. The workshop is targeted at anyone interested in the relevance of computational techniques for understanding first, second and bilingual language acquisition and language change in normal and clinical conditions. Long and short papers are invited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

*Computational learning theory and analysis of language learning and organization

*Computational models of first, second and bilingual language acquisition

*Computational models of language changes in clinical conditions

*Computational models and analysis of factors that influence language acquisition and use in different age groups and cultures

*Computational models of various aspects of language and their interaction effect in acquisition, processing and change

*Computational models of the evolution of language

*Data resources and tools for investigating computational models of human language processes

*Empirical and theoretical comparisons of the learning environment and its impact on language processes

*Cognitively oriented Bayesian models of language processes

*Computational methods for acquiring various linguistic information (related to e.g. speech, morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, and discourse) and their relevance to research on human language acquisition

*Investigations and comparisons of supervised, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods for learning (e.g. machine learning, statistical, symbolic, biologically-inspired, active learning, various hybrid models) from a cognitive perspective

---------------------------------------------------------------

SUBMISSIONS



We invite three different submission modalities:



 * Regular long papers (8 content pages + 1 page for references):

   Long papers should report on original, solid and finished research

   including new experimental results, resources and/or techniques.



 * Regular short papers (4 content pages + 1 page for references):

   Short papers should report on small experiments, focused contributions,

   ongoing research, negative results and/or philosophical discussion.



 * System demonstration (2 pages): System demonstration papers should

   describe and document the demonstrated system or resources. We

   encourage the demonstration of both early research prototypes and

   mature systems, that will be presented in a separate demo session.



All submissions must be in PDF format and must follow the EMNLP

2015 formatting requirements.



We strongly advise the use of the provided Word or LaTeX template

files. For long and short papers, the reported research should

be substantially original. The papers will be presented orally or as

posters. The decision as to which paper will be presented orally

and which as poster will be made by the program committee based

on the nature rather than on the quality of the work.



Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information

should be included in the papers; self-reference should be

avoided as well. Papers that do not conform to these requirements

will be rejected without review. Accepted papers will appear in the

workshop proceedings, where no distinction will be made between

papers presented orally or as posters.



Submission and reviewing will be electronic, managed by the START system:



https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2015/CogACLL



Submissions must be uploaded onto the START system by the submission deadline:



      June 28, 2015 (11:59pm GMT -12 hours)



Please choose the appropriate submission type from the START

submission page, according to the category of your paper.

The 8th SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing (SIGHAN-8) at ACL-IJCNLP 2015, July 30-31, 2015, Beijing, China



https://sites.google.com/site/sighan8/call-for-papers



 



Growing interest in Chinese language processing is leading to the development of linguistic corpora and automatic tools. As more resources have become available recently, it is crucial to create a platform that allows easy exchange of information and data and the comparison of different approaches to various NLP tasks. Among about 20 SIGs within the Association for Computational Linguistics, SIGHAN (Special Interest Group on Chinese Language Processing) provides an umbrella for researchers in industry and academia working in various aspects of Chinese language processing. SIGHAN workshop provides an international forum for both researchers and practitioners to report their latest innovations, summarize state-of-the-art in the field, as well as exchange ideas, results, and visions in all aspects of Chinese language processing.



 



The previous SIGHAN workshop series were started in 2002. SIGHAN-1 was held in conjunction with COLING-02 (Taipei, Taiwan); SIGHAN-2 was held in conjunction with ACL-03 (Sapporo, Japan); SIGHAN-3 was held in conjunction with ACL-04 (Barcelona, Spain); SIGHAN-4 was held in conjunction with IJCNLP-05 (Jeju Island, Korea); SIGHAN-5 was held in conjunction with ACL-COLING-06 (Sydney, Australia); SIGHAN-6 was held in conjunction with IJCNLP-08 (Hyderabad, India); SIGHAN-7 was held in conjunction with IJCNLP-13 (Nagoya, Japan). Following the successes of previous SIGHAN workshops, ACL-IJCNLP 2015 in Beijing, China will provide yet another ideal opportunity to bring together again influential as well as aspiring researchers from Asia Pacific, and those from many others from Europe and USA, to deliberate and interact on a range of research issues.



 



The purpose of the SIGHAN-8 is to identify challenging problems facing the development of Chinese language processing systems, and to shape future research directions through the publication of high quality, applied and theoretical research findings. We encourage submissions of papers on all topics in the general areas related to computational linguistics and speech/text processing of Chinese natural languages. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:



l   Discourse and pragmatics



l   Generation and summarization



l   Information retrieval and extraction



l   Language resources and evaluation



l   Lexical semantics



l   Lexicon acquisition



l   Machine learning for NLP



l   Machine translation



l   NLP applications



l   NLP for the Web and social media



l   Question answering



l   Spoken language processing



l   Sentiment analysis and opinion mining



l   Text categorization



l   Tagging, Chunking, and Parsing



l   Word sense disambiguation

The bi-annual meeting of the German Society for Computational Linguistics

and Language Technology (GSCL) in 2015 will take place from September 30

to October 2 at the University of Duisburg-Essen.



The GSCL Organizing Committee invites proposals for workshops and tutorials to be held in conjunction with the GSCL conference. We solicit proposals on any topic of interest to the ACL/GSCL communities, including, but not limited to topics in Natural Language Processing or interdisciplinary research areas between computational linguistics and other research fields (machine learning, web 2.0, semantic web, psychology etc.).



Workshops provide an opportunity to discuss current topics in a small and interactive atmosphere. They can concentrate in-depth on research topics, but can also be devoted to application issues, or to questions concerning the economic and social aspects of NLP and web mining. Although we encourage workshops on novel and original topics, we also accept successors to workshops at previous ACL, GSCL or related conferences.





WORKSHOPS



Workshops will be half-day or full-day and will be held on

*September 28 or 29, 2015*



Proposals will be reviewed by the conference organizing committee.





SUBMISSION DETAILS

Proposals for workshops should contain:

1. A title and brief (2-page max) description of the workshop topic and content.

2. An estimate of the number of attendees.

3. The desired workshop length -- half-day or full-day.

4. The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of the organizers, with one-paragraph statements of their research interests and areas of expertise.

5. A list of potential members of the program committee, with an indication of which members have already agreed to serve.

TUTORIALS



The GSCL-2015 Organizing Committee invites proposals for half-day tutorials.

Tutorials are intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to core techniques and areas of interest for the GSCL community. We are interested in tutorials on established or emerging research topics in these areas but we also welcome tutorials from related research fields or applications. The ideal tutorial should attract a wide audience. It should be broad enough to provide a basic introduction to the chosen research area, but it should also cover the most important topics in depth. Each tutorial should be well-focused so that its content can be covered in a half day slot (3.5h including a 30-minute break). Proposals that exclusively focus on the presenter's own work, a particular project or commercial presentations are discouraged.

Tutorial slides will be made available online at the main conference website; authors can provide them in additional websites as well.

Tutorial speakers will be offered the possibility of a reduced or waived registration fee, depending on the number of speakers for the tutorial.



SUBMISSION DETAILS

The tutorial proposals should contain:

1. A title and abstract of the tutorial.

2. A brief description of the tutorial content and its relevance to the GSCL community (no more than 2 pages).

3. A brief outline of the tutorial structure showing that the tutorial's core content can be covered in a 3.5 hours slot (including a coffee break).

4. The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of the tutorial instructors, including one-paragraph statement of their research interests and areas of expertise.

5. A list of previous venues and approximate audience sizes, if the same or a similar tutorial has been given elsewhere; otherwise an estimate of the audience size.

6. A description of special requirements for technical equipment (e.g., internet access).



Proposals should be submitted in PDF by electronic mail

*no later than March 1, 2015*

to: gscl2015@gscl.org

The subject line should be: ""GSCL-2015: TUTORIAL PROPOSAL"".



The proponents will receive an email confirmation that their proposal has been received. If no confirmation arrives within 72 hours after sending the proposal, the proponents should contact the tutorial chair again.



GSCL will offer publicity of the tutorials on the GSCL website, free rooms for up to 25-30 people (larger rooms might be arranged, if an application indicates higher foreseen attendance), no separate registration fee (covered by main registration), as well as a complimentary coffee break.



PROPOSAL REVIEW

All proposals will be reviewed by the organizing committee, who may use the help of external reviewers on the submission topics.

The features that will be evaluated are: (i) the interestingness for the GSCL areas, which should result in a large audience; (ii) the clarity of the tutorial, which should emerge from its description; (iii) good organization as appearing from the outline; (iv) the adequacy of the speakers, i.e., her/his background/experience in teaching the target topics; and (v) the ability to explain the topics to a large audience with heterogeneous background.

Accepted tutorial speakers will be asked to provide an abstract (ASCII format) of their tutorials for advertisement purposes in the conference website. Tutorial speakers must provide their tutorial materials (pdf format), at least containing copies of the course slides as well as a bibliography for the material covered in the tutorial, by August 31, 2015.

It is based on the idea of a shared abstract syntax and mappings between the abstract syntax and concrete languages. GF grammars are bi-directional; however, they are particularly well suited for language generation.



What makes the development of GF application grammars rapid and flexible is the general-purpose GF resource grammar library which currently covers more than 30 languages implementing the same abstract syntax, a shared syntactic API.



Compiled GF grammars can be embedded in applications written in other programming languages. GF has a command interpreter and a batch compiler, as well as Haskell and C run-time systems for parsing and linearization. The C run-time system has Java and Python bindings, and it allows for probabilistic parsing as well. There are hundreds of GF users all over the world.



Among ongoing research projects, there are efforts to integrate GF with Universal Dependencies, FrameNet, Abstract Meaning Representation, and other syntactic and semantic models. Thus, the special theme for the 5th summer school: GF in a Full Stack of Language Technology.

    (GSCL-2015)

30th September - 2nd October 2015

University of Duisburg-Essen, Campus Essen, Germany



Summary

--------------------------------------

The bi-annual meeting of the German Society for Computational

Linguistics and Language Technology (GSCL) in 2015 will take place from

September 30 to October 2 at the University of Duisburg-Essen.



The main conference theme is ""Deep vs. shallow?"".



Currently, computational linguistics as a field seems to split in two

camps: Those interested in 'deep', explanatory, potentially even

cognitively motivated models and those interested in harnessing the

power of emerging big data collections to solve practical problems

efficiently. While the first camp often fights with a lack of coverage

of the intended phenomena, the second camp is occasionally criticized

as naively counting the contents of bags of words.

Of course, the conference theme is designed to provoke contradiction:

Isn't the goal ultimately a synthesis of both approaches that allows

linguistic theory to use 'big data' efficiently and allows broad

coverage technologies to be theoretically well-founded? The conference

aims to discuss the divergence of 'deep' and 'shallow' analysis, but

especially also how to achieve to a synthesis constructively.



Contributions to any topic related to Computational Linguistics and

Language Technology are invited, but we especially encourage

submissions that are related to the main theme, i.e., connecting broad

coverage technologies with linguistic and cognitive theory, e.g.

- learning deep grammars from corpora,

- hybrid machine translation systems,

- making use of 'big data' collections, e.g. for

  - distributional semantics, or

  - analysis of non-standard orthography texts or learner corpora



GSCL Prize

--------------------------------------

The GSCL awards a prize for the best student thesis (Bachelor, Master,

Diploma, Magister) in the field of language technology and

computational linguistics. Theses from the last two years are eligible

and nominations must be made by a supervisor from an academic

institution within the German-speaking area.

Deadline for nominations: 15th May 2015

Submission

--------------------------------------

Submissions to GSCL-2015 must describe unpublished work and may be

written in English or German. We invite long, short, and demo papers.

Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus at

most two extra pages for references and appendices.

Short papers may consist of an extended abstract of up to two (2) pages

including references.

Long papers typically describe original research and will be presented

in the main track. Short papers (typically: ongoing research, project

or system description, opinion piece) will be presented in a special

track with short lighting talks or posters.

Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee

members. Final versions should take into account the comments from the

reviewers.



As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not include the authors'

names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the

author's identity, e.g. ""We previously showed (Smith, 2011) ..."" must

be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ""Smith previously showed

(Smith,

2011) ..."". Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be

      rejected without review. In addition, please do not post your

      submissions on the web until after the review process is

      complete. For a paper to be included in the conference

      proceedings, at least one of the authors must be registered as a

      participant at the GSCL-2015 conference.



Papers will be submitted using the START system, which will be

accessible from the conference web page. Double submission of papers

will need to be notified at submission. Formatting instructions will be

made available on the conference web page.

In conjunction witH ACM ICMI 2015

Seattle, November 13, 2015



http://lit.eecs.umich.edu/icmi-workshop/



============================================================



CALL FOR PAPERS



The widespread use of deception in offline and online communication suggests the need for methods to automatically detect deceit. The 2015 ACM Workshop on Multimodal Deception Detection (WMDD 2015) will focus on multimodal and interdisciplinary approaches to deception detection, as well as approaches that utilize a single modality with clear potential for integration with additional modalities. Deception detection has received an increasing amount of attention due to the significant growth of digital media, as well as increased ethical and security concerns. Earlier approaches to deception detection were mainly focused on law enforcement applications and relied on polygraph tests, which had proven to falsely accuse the innocent and free the guilty in multiple cases. More recent work on deception has expanded to other applications, such as deception detection in social media, interviews, or deception in day-by-day interactions. Moreover, recent research on deception detection has brought together scientists from fields as diverse as computational linguistics, speech processing, computer vision, psychology, and physiology, which makes this problem particularly appealing for multimodal processing. The goal of this workshop is to provide the participants with a forum to foster the dissemination of ideas on computational and behavioral methodologies for deception detection. 



TOPICS

We encourage the submission of papers that address the multimodal perspective of deception detection, as well as papers that use clues from a single modality but with the clear potential of being integrated with additional modalities. We also encourage the submission of interdisciplinary work stemming from a variety of fields such as computational linguistics, speech processing, computer vision, psychology, physiology, and others. The topics include, but are not limited to:

- Deception detection using multimodal processing, including modalities such as text, speech, thermal, and visual

- Deception detection using a single modality, with a potential to be integrated with other modalities

- Deception detection applied to real world applications, including healthcare, law enforcement, and others

- Study of nonverbal behaviors associated to deception

- The role of psychology in deception detection

- The role of physiology in deception detection

- Ways to integrate multiple modalities, including feature-based and decision-based fusion, and temporal alignment

- Deception detection in social media

- The construction of datasets for deception detection, from real or simulated environments

NLP tools contests at ICON 2015



The ICON 2014 tools contest is on on Statistical Machine Translation in Indian Languages(IL). Machine translation (MT) is the process of encoding the syntactic and semantic information of a source language text into a target language. In past two decades, MT has shown very promising results particularly using Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) especially for English and other European Languages. However, its effectiveness in translating sentences within Indian Languages (IL) and between English and Indian languages needs to be explored further. The NLP tool contest in ICON 2014 aims to collectively explore the effectiveness of SMT while translating within ILs and between English and ILs.

*********

Overview

*********

This seminar aims to discuss the fundamental and applied problems in social media, artificial intelligence, natural language and multimedia processing, and crowdsourcing technologies. The main goal of this event is to unite researchers who study social interactions on the Internet, as well as researchers from the related fields without whose contribution the study of social networks would become difficult or impossible. Our task is to discuss how to analyze the digital traces left behind by a person's activities and what conclusions can be made based on this analysis. 



We welcome researchers from both humanities and technical sciences who study social networks and social interactions on the Internet, the relationship between the virtual and real-world identities. The task is to create an interdisciplinary platform for the integration of artificial intelligence and data mining approaches with sociological, psychological and linguistic studies. The event focuses on two main points: (1) integration of data mining and social mining approaches with the approaches from humanities and other technical disciplines, (2) integration of the natural language/multimedia processing with the personalized services on the Web.



This seminar continues a series of events including the 1st Intensive Social Media Week (2015), the AINL-ISMW FRUCT conference (2015), the ISMW FRUCT school and conference (2016), ISMW seminar (2017, 2018).



Young scientists and researchers from scientific centers, students and graduates, as well as industrial partners are welcome to participate.



Topics of interest include the following subject areas:

• Social Mining

• Deception Detection and Personality Recognition

• Authorship and Profiling

• Social Copying Detection

• Social Media Metrics

• Data Mining for Social Networks, Multimedia and Natural Language Processing

• Sociology, Psychology, Marketing Studies of Social Networks and Social Media

• Information Retrieval in Social Media

• Crowdsourcing Technologies



Young scientists and researchers from scientific centers, students and graduates, as well as industrial partners are welcome to participate. Early registration is a cost effective way to participate in the Workshop and the 25th IEEE FRUCT conference. All workshop papers will be published Open Access in FRUCT proceeding at no additional cost (available for free under a CC BY-ND license download from FRUCT proceedings catalog). The workshop posters and demos can be presented on the FRUCT25 Demo Session on 7 November 2019.

The 2nd Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing (SDP 2021) is hosting 3 Shared Tasks tackling key NLP challenges in summarization, claim verification, and citation context classification. Participating teams will be invited to submit their works for presentation at the SDP 2021 workshop on June 10 at NAACL 2021.

 

The call for participation is described below. More details can be found on our website, alongside our usual call for Research track papers.

Mailing list:  https://groups.google.com/g/sdproc-updates





** Task 1: LongSumm - Generating Long Summaries for Scientific Documents **

 

Most of the work on scientific document summarization focuses on generating relatively short summaries (250 words or less). While such a length constraint can be sufficient for summarizing news articles, it is far from sufficient for summarizing scientific work. In fact, such a short summary resembles more to an abstract than to a summary that aims to cover all the salient information conveyed in a given text. Writing such summaries requires expertise and a deep understanding in a scientific domain, as can be found in some researchers’ blogs.

 

The LongSumm task opted to leverage blogs created by researchers in the NLP and Machine learning communities and use these summaries as reference summaries to compare the submissions against.

 

The corpus for this task includes a training set that consists of 1705 extractive summaries and around 700 abstractive summaries of NLP and Machine Learning scientific papers. These are drawn from papers based on video talks from associated conferences (TalkSumm: https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01351) and from blogs created by NLP and ML researchers. In addition, we create a test set of abstractive summaries. Each submission is judged against one reference summary (gold summary) on ROUGE and should not exceed 600 words.

 

The training data is composed of abstractive and extractive summaries. To download both datasets, and for further details, see the LongSumm GitHub repository: https://sdproc.org/2021/sharedtasks.html and our website: https://sdproc.org/2021/sharedtasks.html#longsumm.

 

 

** Task 2: SciVer - Scientific Claim Verification** 

 

Due to the rapid growth in scientific literature, it is difficult for scientists to stay up-to-date on the latest findings. This challenge is especially acute during pandemics due to the risk of making decisions based on outdated or incomplete information. There is a need for AI systems that can help scientists with information overload and support scientific fact checking and evidence synthesis.

 

In the SciVer shared task, we will build systems that can take a scientific claim as input, identify all relevant abstracts from a large corpus that Support or Refute the claim, and also provide rationales/supporting evidence. Here's a live demo of what such a system would do: https://scifact.apps.allenai.org/. 

 

We will use the SciFact dataset of 1409 expert-annotated biomedical claims verified against 5183 abstracts from peer-reviewed publications. Download the full dataset and any baseline models from GitHub (https://github.com/allenai/scifact). Find out more from the EMNLP 2020 paper: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.609/.  

 

To register, please send an email to sciver-info@allenai.org with:

- Team name

- Participant (full) names

- Participant affiliation(s)

- Email(s) for primary contact(s)

 

Feel free to contact the organizers at sciver-info@allenai.org. More details are available on the shared task page: https://sdproc.org/2021/sharedtasks.html#sciver.

 

 

** Task 3: 3C - Citation Context Classification** 

 

Recent years have witnessed a massive increase in the amount of scientific literature and research data being published online, providing revelation about the advancements in the field of different domains. The introduction of aggregator services like CORE (https://core.ac.uk/) has enabled unprecedented levels of open access to scholarly publications. The availability of full text of the research documents facilitates the possibility of extending the bibliometric studies by identifying the context of the citations (http://oro.open.ac.uk/51751/). The shared task organized as part of the SDP 2021 workshop focuses on classifying citation context in research publications based on their influence and purpose:

 

Subtask A: A task for identifying the purpose of a citation. Multiclass classification of citations into one of six classes: Background, Uses, Compares_Contrasts, Motivation, Extension, and Future.

 

Subtask B: A task for identifying the importance of a citation. Binary classification of citations into one of two classes: Incidental, and Influential.

 

A sample training dataset can be downloaded by filling the following registration form: https://forms.gle/AjYfMrTzZXjfBjgS6. The full training dataset will be released shortly via the Kaggle platform (https://www.kaggle.com/).

 

More information about the dataset and the shared task can be found on the workshop website: https://sdproc.org/2021/sharedtasks.html#3c 

 

To register please use the following form: https://forms.gle/AjYfMrTzZXjfBjgS6

INTRODUCTION

Human translation and Machine Translation (MT) aim to solve the same problem (i.e. translating from one language into another) in two seemingly different ways. 



There are many Natural Language Processing (NLP)/Computational linguistics efforts towards improving the work of translators and interpreters (for example Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) tools, electronic dictionaries, concordancers, spell-checkers, terminological databases and terminology extraction tools, translation memories, partial machine translation of template documents, speech recognition systems for automatic subtitling, etc.). In turn, the NLP field makes use of the work and the knowledge of professional translators and interpreters in to build models for automatic translation - e.g. by using parallel aligned text and speech corpora for text and speech machine translation learning, human evaluators of machine translation output, human annotations for automatic MT post-editing or using eye-tracking for learning editing patterns of professional translators, etc. 



While there have been many workshops and conferences representing both sides: 1) Machine Translation in NLP (e.g. WMT, EAMT conferences), and 2) Automatic tools for translators and interpreters in Translation/Interpreting studies (e.g. Translating and The Computer, and the MT Summit conferences), there has not been a common publication & discussion venue for both sides.

What makes our workshop unique is that it is a unified workshop which welcomes the contributions of both fields towards each other.



This workshop addresses BOTH the most recent developments in contributions of NLP to translation/interpreting and the contributions of translation/interpreting to NLP/MT. In this way it addresses the interests of researchers & specialists in both areas and their joint collaborations, aiming for example to improve their own tasks with the techniques & knowledge of the other field or to help the development of the other field with their own techniques & knowledge.



Workshop website: http://rgcl.wlv.ac.uk/hit-it/



2. TOPICS

Submissions are invited on the following and other similar topics:



- NLP approaches & systems for building educational tools & resources for interpreters 

- NLP approaches & systems for building educational tools & resources for translators

- Computer-assisted translation tools, such as translation memories, machine translation, etc.

- Translation resources, such as corpora, terminological databases, dictionaries

- Computer-assisted interpreting software, such as interpreters workbench, etc.

- Interpreting resources, such as corpora, terminological databases, dictionaries

- User requirements for interpreting and translation tools

- Methodologies for collecting user requirements

- Human accuracy metrics and human evaluation of machine translation

- Theoretical papers with translators/interpreters views on how machine translation should work/what output should produce

- Pre-editing and post-editing of machine translation

- Theoretical papers and practical applications on applying translation techniques & knowledge to NLP and machine translation

- Theoretical papers and practical applications on applying interpreting techniques & knowledge to NLP and machine translation

- Human-in-the-loop in automatic generation of inter-lingual subtitles





Given the focus of the workshop, submitted papers should underline their interdisciplinarity and how they gain insights/make contributions from one field to another (human vs automatic translation/interpreting).



Researchers and practitioners in the two fields are invited to submit full papers describing original completed research, short papers presenting ongoing research ideas and demos of working systems. Both theoretical ideas and practical applications are welcome.



The workshop will organise a poster session, should enough submissions be collected.



The workshop will also include a round table featuring discussion of how both fields can be of use to each other, and an invited talk of a well-known researcher in the field.



A special issue of a journal on this topic is planned. Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their articles. More details will be announced in the Second call for papers.

The Modern Machine Learning & Natural Language Processing Workshop will be held in conjunction with Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) on December 12, 2014 in Palais des Congrès de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  



Overview:



The structure, complexity, and sheer diversity and variety of human language makes Natural Language Processing (NLP) distinct from other areas of AI.  Certain core NLP problems (e.g., sequence tagging and syntactic parsing) have a long history of being abstracted into machine learning (ML) formulations and have thus traditionally been an inspiration for ML-driven solutions, leading to a transfer of ideas from one field to the other.  Problems in NLP are also appealing to those working on core ML research problems due to the high-dimensional and sparse nature of these problems and the need for robust solutions that gracefully handle noise in the training data.  



But there are many other areas within NLP where the ML community is less involved, such as semantics, discourse and pragmatics analysis, summarization, and parts of machine translation, and that continue to rely on linguistically-motivated but imprecise heuristics which may benefit from new ML approaches.  Similarly, there are new developments and paradigms in ML that may be particularly appropriate for NLP, but which have not been explored in this domain.  Our aim in this workshop is to bridge this gap. and showcase the latest advances at the intersection of ML and NLP and address core questions that are relevant to researchers in both communities.  



The workshop invites paper submissions that will be presented in poster format.  Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

     - representation learning for NLP

     - novel theoretical ideas with assumptions suitable to NLP

     - scalable inference/optimization techniques

     - weakly-supervised approaches to handle lack of annotated data in complex structured prediction tasks

     - problems in multilinguality, NLP for social media, discourse analysis, semantics, and other areas that would benefit from ML approaches and analysis



Submissions should be written as extended abstracts, no longer than 4 pages (excluding references) in the NIPS latex style.  Relevant work previously presented in other conferences is encouraged, though submitters should note this in their submission. All submissions should be emailed to nips2014mlnlp@gmail.com

1. Introduction



Researchers increasingly report their results through online publications, from research papers, data and software to experiments, observations and ideas. Immense amount of research-related data is available on the web on interlinked pages, in repositories, databases, social networking sites, etc. Consequently, researchers rely on online sources, often through search engines, to perform literature searches for their research — to search for papers, topics, people etc. to be able to produce new research. However, these publications can be used not only for traditional literature searches, but also as a source for discovering popular and emerging research topics, key publications and people or evaluating research excellence. To aid research, it is important to leverage the potential of data mining technologies to improve the process of how research is being done.



2. Expected audience



This workshop aims to bring together people from different backgrounds who are interested in analysing and mining scholarly data available via web and social media sources using various approaches such as query log mining, graph analysis, text mining, etc., and/or who develop systems that enable such analysis and mining.



3. Topics



The topics of this workshop include, but are not limited to:



* Crawling, harvesting and detecting scholarly outputs on the web, such as publications, datasets, research blogs, research forums, research communication on social networks, etc.

SLAM workshop aims at bringing together researchers working in speech, language and audio processing to analyze, index and access multimedia data. Multimedia data are now available in very large amounts: Lectures, meetings, interviews, debates, conversational broadcast, podcasts, social videos on the Web, etc. Such data, along with the associated use scenarios, raise specific challenges: Robustness facing the high variability in quality; Efficiency to handle very large amount of data; Semantics shared across modalities; Potentially high error rates in transcription; etc. Worldwide, several national and international research projects are focusing on audio analysis of multimedia data. Similarly, various benchmark initiatives have been initiated such as TRECVID MED, MediaEval, or ETAPE and REPERE in France.



The SLAM workshop intends to bring together players from the field to share recent research results, discuss ongoing and future projects, benchmarking initiatives and applications. We expect communications on research work, project description, evaluation initiative, demonstrations and applications dealing with speech and/or language and/or audio on any type of multimedia material. The list of topics of interest includes (but is not limited to):

● Audio event detection and audio classification

● Speech and speaker recognition on multimedia material

● Audio-aware genre analysis and classification

● Multimodal speaker identification and clustering

● Multimedia spoken term detection and content retrieval

● Speech and audio aware content segmentation and structuring

● Audio indexing and fingerprinting

● Robust feature extraction and processing

● Natural language processing for multimedia

● Metadata extraction: Entity extraction, keyword extraction, etc.

● Summarization and hyperlink generation

● Multimodal fusion and integration involving audio

● Generation of descriptive text for multimedia

● Speech and audio multimedia applications and services

● Databases and benchmarks

● Large scale speech and audio analysis

● Navigation in multimedia audio content applied to any media such as:

● Professional broadcasts – TV, radio, podcasts, newsfeeds, synopsis, etc.

● Social media – YouTube, Flickr, Facebook, Twitter, Voice Social Network, etc.

● Audiovisual archives – Lectures and conferences, meetings, etc.

● Music – Music catalogs, music collections, etc.

● Affective and behavioural analytics based on multimodal cues



SLAM 2014 is organized in conjunction with Interspeech 2014 over 1.5 days, starting Thu. 11 Sept. 2014 and ending Fri. 12 Sept. 2014 afternoon.

"1624353501-949","http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=natural%20language%20processing&page=10","IRASL 2018","http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=80125&copyownerid=126388","Domains of natural and spoken language processing have a rich history deeply rooted in information theory, statistics, digital signal processing and machine learning. With the rapid rise of deep learning (‘‘deep learning revolution’’), many of these systematic approaches have been replaced by variants of deep neural methods, that often achieve unprecedented performance levels in many fields. With more and more of the spoken language processing pipeline being replaced by sophisticated neural layers, feature extraction, adaptation, noise robustness are learnt inherently within the network. More recently, end-to-end frameworks that learn a mapping from speech (audio) to target labels (words, phones, graphemes, sub-word units, etc.) are becoming increasingly popular across the board in speech processing in tasks ranging from speech recognition, speaker identification, language/dialect identification, multilingual speech processing, code switching, natural language processing, speech synthesis and much much more. A key aspect behind the success of deep learning lies in the discovered low and high-level representations, that can potentially capture relevant underlying structure in the training data. In the NLP domain, for instance, researchers have mapped word and sentence embeddings to semantic and syntactic similarity and argued that the models capture latent representations of meaning.



Nevertheless, some recent works on adversarial examples have shown that it is possible to easily fool a neural network (such as a speech recognizer or a speaker verification system) by just adding a small amount of specially constructed noise. Such a remarkable sensibility towards adversarial attacks highlights how superficial the discovered representations could be, rising crucial concerns on the actual robustness, security, and interpretability of modern deep neural networks. This weakness naturally leads researchers to ask very crucial questions on what these models are really learning, how we can interpret what they have learned, and how the representations provided by current neural networks can be revealed or explained in a fashion that modeling power can be enhanced further. These open questions have recently raised the interest towards interpretability of deep models, as witness by the numerous works recently published on this topic in all the major machine learning conferences. Moreover, some workshops at Neural Information Processing Systems 2016 and 2017 and Interspeech 2017 have promoted research and discussion around this important issue.



With our initiative, we wish to further foster some progresses on interpretability and robustness of modern deep learning techniques, with a particular focus on audio, speech and NLP technologies. The workshop will also analyze the connection between deep learning and models developed earlier for machine learning, linguistic analysis, signal processing, and speech recognition. This way we hope to encourage a discussion among experts and practitioners in these areas with the expectation of understanding these models better and allowing to build upon the existing collective expertise.



The workshop will feature invited talks, panel discussions, as well as oral and poster contributed presentations. We welcome papers that specifically address one or more of the leading questions listed below:



Is there a theoretical/linguistic motivation/analysis that can explain how nets encapsulate the structure of the training data it learns from?

Does the visualization of this information (MDS, t-SNE) offer any insights to creating a better model?

How can we design more powerful networks with simpler architectures?

How can we can exploit adversarial examples to improve the system robustness?

Do alternative methods offer any complimentary modeling power to what the networks can memorize?

Can we explain the path of inference?

How do we analyze data requirements for a given model? How does multilingual data improves learning power?

  18th - 19th June 2015

  Computer Science School – Complutense University of Madrid (Spain)



Relevant Dates:

  * Paper submission: March 26, 2015

  * Author Notification: April 23, 2015

We often use languages. First, to communicate between ourselves. Later, to communicate with computers. And more recently, with the advent of networks, we found a way to make computers communicate between themselves. All these different forms of communication use languages, different languages, but that still share many similarities. In SLATE we are interested in discussing these languages.

Being languages such a broad subject, SLATE is organized in three main tracks:



  1) HCL Track: Processing Human-Computer Languages The HCL track is where researchers, developers and educators exchange ideas and information on the latest academic or industrial work on language design, processing, assessment and applications.

  2) CCL Track: Processing Computer-Computer Languages The CCL track main goal is to provide a broad space for discussion about the XML mark-up language: examples of usage and associated technologies.

  3) HHL Track: Processing Human-Human Languages The HHL track is dedicated to the discussion of research projects and ideas involving natural language processing and their industrial application.



A detailed topic list for each one of these tracks is presented below.



HCL Track: Processing Human-Computer Languages

Programming language concepts and methodologies; Language and Grammars, design, formal specification and quality; Design of novel language constructs and their implementation; Domain Specific Languages design and implementation; Programming tools; Programming, refactoring and debugging environments; Dynamic and static analysis: Program Slicing; Program Comprehension; Program Visualization and Animation; Compilation and interpretation techniques; Code generation and optimization; Programming Languages teaching methods;



CCL Track: Processing Computer-Computer Languages

Semantic Web and Ontologies; Methodologies for specification in XML XML compression, serialization and merging XML Parsing and Querying; XML Structuring XML Transformation XML Security Web Services -- Architectures and Practical Cases Web Technologies and Frameworks XML Libraries and digital repositories E-learning systems, standards and interoperability Serialization languages



HHL Track: Processing Human-Human Languages

Computational morphology, syntax and semantics; Machine translation and tools for computer assisted translation; Computational terminology and lexicography; Speech synthesis and understanding; Information retrieval, extraction and automatic question answering; Corpora linguistics; NLP system and resource evaluation; Public tools and resources for NLP; Ontologies and knowledge representation; Statistical Methods applied to NLP; Language teaching support tools.

We have also composed a FAQ (check our website) addressing potential topics and approaches to the questions posed in the call for papers. We would also like to emphasize once more that the conference is not exclusive to linguists - researchers and industry representatives from any field working on human language are welcome to share their ideas.



Call for Papers:



After decades of seemingly scattered research, the question of how linguistics fits into the bigger picture of the sciences and the world of knowledge in general has surfaced in connection with new methods and technological advances which deal with natural language and communication, attempt to simulate them, or use linguistic knowledge to interpret human behavior.

This conference proposes a constructive take on the question 'Why?', as in, why are we doing what we are doing as linguists, and what is our contribution to knowledge? Or, equally well, what is the contribution of a particular domain of linguistics to other disciplines, and in turn, their contribution to linguistics? To what end do linguistics and any such neighboring fields of research or industry converge in their methods, results and problem setting? This is intended to be the binding theme of this otherwise highly interdisciplinary event.

In order to approach these issues from a variety of angles, we invite papers on the subject of linguistics in and for:    

- technology and engineering

- neuroscience, psychology, clinical applications

- endangered communities

- understanding human origins

- didactics and acquisition

- translation and terminology

- solving crimes

- understanding thinking and reasoning

- understanding society

- understanding human communication

Taking into account the interdisciplinary nature of the conference, participants are advised to give a brief overview in their presentation of the ""what"" and ""how"" of their research, but nevertheless focus on the ""why"". For researchers working in the applied and technical domains, the answer may be clear due to the inherently more action- or product-oriented nature of their research. However, we believe that open discussion on this topic is beneficial for the realization of the full potential of theoretical linguistic research and for the interaction of linguistics with other disciplines.

Participants from the more applied fields of research should, therefore, put emphasis on the contribution of theoretical domains of linguistics from the point of view of their research, and conversely, representatives of the theoretical fields should point to the applicability of their research. Both positive and negative assessments are equally welcome, as in why we should or should not invest resources in any particular subdomain of linguistics, its methodology, or its application in another field of research or industry.

The working language of the conference is English. The extended abstract submission deadline is the 22nd of February. For further information, see the conference website: http://whylinguistics.ut.ee

** Introduction **

 

Although scientific literature plays a major part in research and policy-making, these texts represent an underserved area of NLP. NLP can play a role in addressing research information overload, identifying disinformation and its effect on people and society, and enhancing the reproducibility of science. The unique challenges of processing scholarly documents necessitate the development of specific methods and resources optimized for this domain. The Scholarly Document Processing (SDP) workshop provides a venue for discussing these challenges, bringing together stakeholders from different communities including computational linguistics, text mining, information retrieval, digital libraries, scientometrics, and others to develop and present methods and resources in support of these goals. 

 

This workshop builds on the success of prior workshops: the 1st SDP workshop held at EMNLP 2020 and the 1st SciNLP workshop held at AKBC 2020. In addition to having broad appeal within the NLP community, we hope the SDP workshop will attract researchers from other relevant fields including meta-science, scientometrics, data mining, information retrieval, and digital libraries, bringing together these disparate communities within ACL.

 



** Topics of Interest **

 

We invite submissions from all communities demonstrating usage of and challenges associated with natural language processing, information retrieval, and data mining of scholarly and scientific documents. Relevant tasks include: 



* Representation learning

* Information extraction

OVERVIEW



This year's workshop will feature five shared tasks:



a translation task,

a quality estimation task,

a task to test automatic evaluation metrics,

a medical text translation task

In addition to the shared tasks, the workshop will also feature scientific papers on topics related to MT. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:



word-based, phrase-based, syntax-based, semantics-based SMT

using comparable corpora for SMT

incorporating linguistic information into SMT

decoding

system combination

error analysis

manual and automatic method for evaluating MT

scaling MT to very large data sets

We encourage authors to evaluate their approaches to the above topics using the common data sets created for the shared tasks.

TRANSLATION TASK



The first shared task which will examine translation between the following language pairs:



English-German and German-English

English-French and French-English

English-Hindi and Hindi-English NEW

English-Czech and Czech-English

English-Russian and Russian-English

Participants may submit translations for any or all of the language directions. In addition to the common test sets the workshop organizers will provide optional training resources, including a newly expanded release of the Europarl corpora and out-of-domain corpora.

All participants who submit entries will have their translations evaluated. We will evaluate translation performance by human judgment. To facilitate the human evaluation we will require participants in the shared tasks to manually judge some of the submitted translations. For each team, this will amount to ranking 300 sets of 5 translations, per language pair submitted.



We also provide baseline machine translation systems, with performance comparable to the best systems from last year's shared task.



QUALITY ESTIMATION TASK



A topic of increasing interest in MT is that of estimating the quality of translated texts. Different from MT evaluation, quality estimation (QE) systems do not rely on reference translations, but rather predict the quality of an unseen translated text (document, sentence, phrase) at system run-time. This topic is particularly relevant from a user perspective: among other applications, it can (i) help decide whether a given translation is good enough for publishing as is (Soricut and Echihabi, 2010); (ii) filter out sentences that are not good enough for post-editing (Specia, 2011); (iii) select the best translation among options from multiple MT and/or translation memory systems (He et al., 2010); and (iv) inform readers of the target language of whether or not they can rely on a translation (Specia et al., 2011).



Although still very recent, research in this topic has been showing promising results in the last couple of years. However, efforts are scattered around several groups and, as a consequence, comparing different systems is difficult as there are neither well established baselines nor standard evaluation metrics. In the Quality-Estimation track of the WMT workshop and shared-task, we will provide training and test sets, along with evaluation metrics and a baseline system. By providing a common ground for development and comparison, we expect to foster research in the topic, as well as to attract new people interested in the subject, who can build and evaluate new solutions using the provided resources.



EVALUATION TASK



The evaluation task will assess automatic evaluation metrics' ability to:

Rank systems on their overall performance on the test set

Rank systems on a sentence by sentence level

Participants in the shared evaluation task will use their automatic evaluation metrics to score the output from the translation task and the system combination task. They will be provided with the output from the other two shared tasks along with reference translations. We will measure the correlation of automatic evaluation metrics with the human judgments.



MEDICAL TEXT TRANSLATION TASK



Details to be announced.



PAPER SUBMISSION INFORMATION



Submissions will consist of regular full papers of 6-10 pages, plus additional pages for references, formatted following the ACL 2013 guidelines. In addition, shared task participants will be invited to submit short papers (4-6 pages) describing their systems or their evaluation metrics. Both submission and review processes will be handled electronically. Note that regular papers must be anonymized, while system descriptions do not need to be.



We encourage individuals who are submitting research papers to evaluate their approaches using the training resources provided by this workshop and past workshops, so that their experiments can be repeated by others using these publicly available corpora.

As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) journal.



IMPORTANT DATES



Submission deadline (long & short papers): March 4

Notification of acceptance: May 13

Camera-ready due: June 3

Note: All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (""anywhere on Earth"").

Long Papers



Long ACL 2019 submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Review forms will be made available prior to the deadlines.



Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited references; final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.



Long papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and which as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings between long papers presented orally and as posters.



Short Papers



ACL 2019 also solicits short papers. Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages. Some kinds of short papers are:



A small, focused contribution

Work in progress

A negative result

An opinion piece

An interesting application nugget

Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given five (5) content pages in the proceedings. Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address reviewers' comments in their final versions.



Short papers will be presented in one or more oral or poster sessions. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers presented orally and as posters.



ANONYMITY AND SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL



As the reviewing will be blind, papers must not include authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., ""We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."" must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ""Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."" Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.



Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents that are not available to the reviewers. For example, do not omit or redact important citation information to preserve anonymity. Instead, use third person or named reference to this work, as described above (“Smith showed” rather than “we showed”).



Papers may be accompanied by a resource (software and/or data) described in the paper. Papers that are submitted with accompanying software/data may receive additional credit toward the overall evaluation, and the potential impact of the software and data will be taken into account when making the acceptance/rejection decisions.



ACL 2019 also encourages the submission of supplementary material to report preprocessing decisions, model parameters, and other details necessary for the replication of the experiments reported in the paper. Seemingly small preprocessing decisions can sometimes make a large difference in performance, so it is crucial to record such decisions to precisely characterize state-of-the-art methods.



Nonetheless, supplementary material should be supplementary (rather than central) to the paper. It may include explanations or details of proofs or derivations that do not fit into the paper, lists of features or feature templates, sample inputs and outputs for a system, pseudo-code or source code, and data. The paper should not rely on the supplementary material: while the paper may refer to and cite the supplementary material and the supplementary material will be available to reviewers, they will not be asked to review or even download the supplementary material. Authors should refer to the contents of the supplementary material in the paper submission, so that reviewers interested in these supplementary details will know where to look.



PAPER SUBMISSION AND TEMPLATES



Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system. The submission site will be announced shortly.



Long/short paper submissions must use the official ACL 2019 style templates. Long papers must not exceed eight (8) pages of content. Short papers must not exceed four (4) pages of content. References do not count against these limits.



Note: The supplementary material does not count towards page limit and should not be included in paper, but should be submitted separately using the appropriate field on the submission website.



All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to the official style guidelines, which are contained in the template files that will become available on the conference website shortly.



MULTIPLE SUBMISSION POLICY



Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time in the START submission form, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted by ACL 2019. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at ACL 2019 must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper will be presented. We will not accept for publication or presentation the papers that overlap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere.



Authors submitting more than one paper to ACL 2019 must ensure that submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) with each other in content or results.



ACL AUTHOR GUIDELINES



ACL 2019 adopts the following ACL guidelines for submission and citation. Submissions that do not conform to these guidelines will be rejected without review.



Preserving Double Blind Review



The following rules and guidelines are meant to protect the integrity of double-blind review and ensure that submissions are reviewed fairly. The rules make reference to the anonymity period, which runs from 1 month before the submission deadline up (starting February 4, 2019) to the date when your paper is either accepted, rejected, or withdrawn.



You may not make a non-anonymized version of your paper available online to the general community (for example, via a preprint server) during the anonymity period. By a version of a paper we understand another paper having essentially the same scientific content but possibly differing in minor details (including title and structure) and/or in length (e.g., an abstract is a version of the paper that it summarizes).



If you have posted a non-anonymized version of your paper online before the start of the anonymity period, you may submit an anonymized version to the conference. The submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version, and you must inform the program chair(s) that a non-anonymized version exists. You may not update the non-anonymized version during the anonymity period, and we ask you not to advertise it on social media or take other actions that would further compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period.



Note that, while you are not prohibited from making a non-anonymous version available online before the start of the anonymity period, this does make double-blind reviewing more difficult to maintain, and we therefore encourage you to wait until the end of the anonymity period if possible. Alternatively, you may consider submitting your work to the Computational Linguistics journal, which does not require anonymization and has a track for ""short"" (i.e., conference-length) papers.



Citation and Comparison



If you are aware of previous research that appears sound and is relevant to your work, you should cite it even if it has not been peer-reviewed, and certainly if it influenced your own work. However, refereed publications take priority over unpublished work reported in preprints. Specifically:



You are expected to cite all refereed publications relevant to your submission, but you may be excused for not knowing about all unpublished work (especially work that has been recently posted and/or is not widely cited).



In cases where a preprint has been superseded by a refereed publication, the refereed publication should be cited in addition to or instead of the preprint version.



Papers (whether refereed or not) appearing less than 3 months before the submission deadline are considered contemporaneous to your submission, and you are therefore not obliged to make detailed comparisons that require additional experimentation and/or in-depth analysis.



For more information, see the ACL Policies for Submission, Review, and Citation: https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/new-policies-submission-review-and-citation



PRESENTATION REQUIREMENT



All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for ACL 2019 by the early registration deadline.

The 5th Biennial Workshop on Balto-Slavic Natural Language Processing  

(BSNLP 2015)

Hissar, Bulgaria

10-11 September 2015

http://bsnlp-2015.cs.helsinki.fi



Held in conjunction with:

RANLP 2015: Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing 2015

http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2015

5-11 September 2015



The 5th edition of BSNLP workshop will be officially sponsored by ACL Special 

Interest Group on Slavic Natural Language Processing (http://sigslav.cs.helsinki.fi)



THEME AND MOTIVATION



The languages from the Balto­-Slavic group play an important role due to their

diverse cultural heritage and widespread use ­­ with over 400 million speakers

worldwide. The recent political and economic developments in Central and

Eastern Europe have brought Balto-­Slavic societies and their languages into

focus in terms of rapid technological advancement and rapidly expanding

consumer markets.



This Workshop addresses Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the Balto-Slavic

languages. The NLP tasks in urgent need of attention include, but are not

limited to:



* morphological analysis and generation

* morphosyntactic tagging and parsing

* semantic parsing

* lexical semantics

* named-­entity recognition 

* co­reference resolution

* information extraction

* question answering

* information retrieval 

* text summarization

* machine translation

* sentiment analysis



Research on theoretical and applied topics in the context of many Balto-Slavic

languages is still in its early stages. The linguistic phenomena specific to

Balto­-Slavic languages such as rich morphological inflection and free word

order­make the construction of NLP tools for these languages a challenging and

intriguing task.



The goal of this Workshop is to bring together academic researchers and

industry practitioners working on NLP for Balto­Slavic languages. In

particular, the Workshop will serve to stimulate the research on NLP techniques

for Balto­Slavic languages, and to foster the creation of tools for these

languages. The Workshop will provide a forum for exchanging ideas and

experience, discussing difficult­-to-­tackle problems in this field of

research, and making the available resources more widely­ known. One

fascinating aspect of this sub­family of languages is the striking structural

similarity, as well as an easily recognizable core vocabulary and inflectional

inventory spanning the entire group of languages ­­ despite the lack of mutual

intelligibility ­­which creates a special environment, in which researchers can

fully appreciate the shared problems and solutions and communicate naturally.



This Workshop continues the tradition established by the previous BSNLP

Workshops:



* the First BSNLP workshop held in conjunction with ACL 2007 Conference 

  in Prague, Czech Republic;

* the Second BSNLP workshop held in conjunction with IIS 2009: 

  Intelligent Information Systems, in Cracow, Poland;

* the Third BSNLP, held in conjunction with TSD 2011, 14th 

  International Conference on Text, Speech and Dialogue in Plzen, Czech

  Republic;

* the Fourth BSNLP, held in conjunction with ACL 2013 Conference in 

  Sofia, Bulgaria.



SUBMISSION



We accept two types of submissions: (a) full papers and (b) short papers.



Long papers should describe original unpublished work and should indicate the

state of completion of the reported results. Short papers should describe work

in progress, small focused contributions and/or interactive software

demonstrations.



Overlap with previously published work should be clearly mentioned. The authors

should indicate along with their submission if the paper has been submitted

elsewhere, e.g., for the main conference. In particular, in case the paper is

rejected by the main conference, it should be indicated in the submission.



All submissions, both long and short papers, will be judged on correctness,

novelty, technical strength, clarity of presentation, usability, and

significance/relevance to the Workshop. Submissions will be reviewed by at

least three members of the Program Committee.



Reviewing will be blind. Therefore, the paper should not include the authors'

names and affiliations. Self ­citations and other references that reveal the

authors' identities should be avoided.



In particular, submissions describing systems, resources, or solutions that are

made available to the wider public would be strongly encouraged, as this would

help to promote computational linguistics applications for Balto-Slavic

languages.



Long paper submissions should follow the two-column format of RANLP 2015

proceedings not exceeding eight (8) pages of content plus two (2) additional

pages for references. Short paper submissions should follow the same format,

and should not exceed five (5) pages for content plus two (2) additional pages

Gfor references. Submissions must conform to the official style guidelines of

RANLP 2015, which are contained in the style files, and must be in PDF.

Camera-ready versions of accepted papers must be provided in LaTeX format.



OFFICIAL LANGUAGE



The official language of the workshop is English.



PROGRAMME



The workshop will consists of:



* presentations of accepted papers,

* one or two invited talks by prominent researchers in Balto­Slavic NLP,

* a session dedicated to the organisational matters of the recently 

  created ACL Special Interest Group on Slavic Natural Language 

  Processing (SIGSLAV)

* a discussion on potential shared tasks for Slavic languages



IMPORTANT DATES



Submission deadline: 26 June, 2015

Notification of acceptance: 25 July, 2015

Traditionally, the study of information extraction, knowledge processing and language

processing is performed by computer scientists, specializing in the application of computers to

the processing of a natural language and large structured or semi-structured data-bases.

Today, people working in information extraction, knowledge processing, and particularly in

language processing often work as members of interdisciplinary teams, including linguists

(specifically trained in linguistics), language experts (persons with some level of ability in the

languages relevant to a given project), statisticians, and computer scientists. In general,

computational linguistics draws upon the involvement of linguists, computer scientists, experts

in artificial intelligence, mathematicians, logicians, cognitive scientists, cognitive psychologists,

psycholinguists, anthropologists and neuroscientists, among others.

Information extraction as part of knowledge processing and language processing, as well, must

become more connected to the cognitive sciences through the development of cognitive semantic

theories. Information extraction as part of knowledge processing is connected to artificial

intelligence through the development of methods and algorithms for all aspects of language

analysis and their computer implementation. We can see language analysis divided into two parts:

theoretical analysis and application. The theoretical aspect includes standard areas studied in

linguistics methods as semantics, syntax, and morphology or numerical methods as those used in

information retrieval or text-mining. Semantic theories guide the development of lexical theories,

syntactic theories and morphology. Semantic theories can be based on some specific features of

computation, but at the present stage of research, there is a gap between linguistic analysis and

computer applications in two senses: there are many computer applications without linguistic

theoretical support and, conversely, there are a number of theoretical methods with no computer

implementation. Semantic as part of computational linguistic and language processing is very

related to the logic and to logics. If we accept the hypothesis that there is a logic of language and

logics of natural languages, the upstream of each algorithm or method representing the basis of a

AI system of language analysis is a logic and a semantic. The downstream of semantic analysis

can be found in translation, automatic text generation and even automatic annotation of texts or

information retrieval. Generally, the knowledge processing and particularly, the information

extraction must take into account this epistemological chain for to lead to effective, robust and

reliable systems.

What is the GOAL of the track?

This track is intended to present works ranking from logical, mathematical, and statistical models

in syntax and semantics (logic of objects, topological theories of time and space, lexical

associations, etc.) as foundations of the design and analysis to knowledge processing and natural

language processing systems and especially to information extraction.

Who might be interested?

Special tracks, held in parallel with the general conference, are an integral part of the conference.

They provide researchers in focused areas the opportunity to meet and present their work, and

offer a forum for interaction among the broader community of artificial intelligence researchers.

Topics of interest are in all areas related to artificial intelligence.

What kind of studies will be of interest?

Papers and contributions are encouraged for any work relating to Semantic, Logics and

Information Extraction in AI. Topics of interest may include (but are in no way limited to):

1. philosophy of language – new developments,

2. cognitive semantics,

3. logics of language,

4. language modeling,

5. computational linguistics (lexicology; morphology; syntax; semantics).

6. information extraction.

7. domain ontologies, linguistic ontologies.

8. knowledge processing.

9. translation

10. text-mining

Note: We invite original papers (i.e. work not previously submitted, in submission, or to be

submitted to another conference during the reviewing process).

Interested authors should format their papers according to AAAI formatting guidelines. The

papers should be original work (i.e., not submitted, in submission, or submitted to another

conference while in review). Papers should not exceed 6 pages (4 pages for a poster) and

are due by November 16, 2015. For FLAIRS-29, the 2016 conference, the reviewing is a

double blind process. Fake author names and affiliations must be used on submitted papers

to provide double-blind reviewing. Papers must be submitted as PDF through the EasyChair

conference system, which can be accessed through the main conference web site

(http://www.flairs-29.info/). Note: do not use a fake name for your EasyChair login - your

EasyChair account information is hidden from reviewers. Authors should indicate the [your

track name] special track for submissions. The proceedings of FLAIRS will be published

by the AAAI. Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign a form transferring

copyright of their contribution to AAAI. FLAIRS requires that there be at least one full

author registration per paper.

With the rise of social media, emoji have become an extremely popular form of communication in social media. They are equally popular across major social media sites including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. In 2018, Facebook reported that over 700 million messages with emoji are shared on their platform every day while over 900 million emoji are sent in Facebook Messenger without any text content every day. In the same year, Twitter reported that it processed 250 million emoji per month. In 2015, Instagram reported that nearly half of the photo comments posted on Instagram contain emoji and Instagram users tend to replace slang terms using emoji in photo comments. Another study revealed that emoji are slowly taking over emoticons on Twitter. Emoji data generated on social media sites have been utilized to study how emoji are used across different languages, cultures, user communities and as features to learn machine learning models to solve problems that span across many applications, including sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, and sarcasm detection. The ability to automatically process, derive meaning, and interpret text fused with emoji will be essential as society embraces emoji as a standard form of online communication. Thus, Emoji2021 brings together computer and social science researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to discuss and exchange ideas on understanding social, cultural, communicative, and linguistic roles of emoji while leading the discussions on building novel computational methods to understand and interpret them. 

 

Emoji2021 is focused on research and discussions on challenges in emoji understanding, including but not limited to the following research directions. 

 

Challenges in interpreting the meaning of an emoji in a message context 

Novel methods for emoji sense disambiguation 

Novel methods for calculating emoji similarity 

Novel methods for emoji prediction 

Emoji-based retrieval and search 

Challenges in using emoji as a language 

Emoji’s effects on the evolution of language constructs used on social media such as emoticons and slang terms 

Common emoji usages in social media 

Cultural and community-specific emoji meaning evolution and interpretation 

Distinct social and communicative roles of emoji 

Understanding sender intention and receiver interpretation of emoji 

Emoji rendering and interface design challenges 

Applications of emoji in social media 

Emoji and the Law 

Emoji, gender, and identity

Research related to other pictorial representations such as emoticons, stickers, kaomoji, emotes, customized emoji (e.g., bitmoji), and animated gifs 

 

We encourage submissions (full research papers upto 10 pages, short papers upto 4 pages, and demo proposals upto 2 pages) that utilize quantitative, qualitative and mixed research methods to approach the above challenges as contributions. 

 

***************************************

Submission Guidelines

***************************************

4th Swiss Text Analytics Conference – SwissText 2019

====================================================



18-19 June 2019, Winterthur, Switzerland

www.swisstext.org



=================================

Call for Papers and Presentations

=================================



[for Call for Workshops, see below]



SwissText is an annual conference that brings together text analytics experts from industry and academia. The conference is held on June 18-19, 2019 in Winterthur, Switzerland, which is a short train ride (20min) from Zurich.



The conference will have three tracks:

- Swiss Track, with a strong focus on Swiss industry and research.

- Scientific Track, with technical research papers from the international community.

- Demo Track, with hands-on, interactive presentations of current NLP solutions.



The full scientific papers will be published in the conference proceedings, as well as the abstracts of the presentations of the Swiss and the Demo Track.





Swiss Track

===========

The goal of the Swiss Track is to bring together experts from Swiss industry and academia. For this track, we are looking for presentations with a certain ""Swissness"" factor:



- Your company or university is located in Switzerland;

- You provide a text analytics solution for one (or more) of the languages of Switzerland (including Swiss dialects);

- Your product focuses primarily on the Swiss market;

- Or any other factor that connects your presentation to Switzerland.



Presentations can be:

- Showcases

- Applications (If you have a demo, please submit to the Demo Track instead)

- Resources

- Research results

- Or any other contribution that is interesting to the audience.



In this track, we also welcome scientific contributions that were already published in other conferences or journals - as long as they have a Swissness factor.



For the Swiss Track, only a short abstract (up to 1500 characters) has to be submitted, along with a CV of the presenter (max 500 chars) and the intended audience (e.g. developers, decision makers, project managers, max. 300 chars). All data is entered online via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=swisstext2019



Note: If you intend to publish a novel, fully scientific paper with a Swiss-related topic, please submit it to the Scientific Track. If you would like to present mainly a demo of your solution, please submit to the Demo Track.





Scientific Track

================

SwissText has the goal to feature a profound technical program. We invite submissions of scientific papers in all areas in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computational Linguistics (CL), and Machine Learning/Data Science with a focus on Text Analytics.



Submission format:

- Please use the ACL LaTeX template: http://acl2017.org/downloads/acl17-latex.zip

- Up to 8 pages, excluding references

- Language: English

- Anonymize: The review process will be double blind; we ask authors to anonymize their submission reasonably. Instead of e.g. ""We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."", write ""Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...""

- Manuscripts must describe original work that has neither been published before, nor is currently under review elsewhere.

- Submission will be made through EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=swisstext2019 





Demo Track

==========

For the first time, SwissText will feature a dedicated track for demonstrations of working and available NLP solutions (open source and proprietary). The goal is to give developers, companies, and researchers a platform to showcase their products and tools, and for the audience to get an overview of production-ready NLP solutions. 



Please provide a short abstract of your demo (1500 characters) and a description of the intended audience (e.g. developers, researchers, etc., max. 300 chars). All data is entered online via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=swisstext2019

1st Call for Papers

http://www.unifor.br/ppgia/propor2022

*************************************************************************************



Dear all,



The International Conference on Computational Processing of Portuguese (PROPOR) is the main event in the area of human language processing that is focused on theoretical and technological issues of written and spoken Portuguese and Galician. The meeting has been a very rich forum for the exchange of ideas and partnerships for the research and industry communities dedicated to the automated processing of Portuguese, promoting the development of methodologies, resources and projects that can be shared among researchers and practitioners in the field.



We call for papers describing work on any topic related to computational language and speech processing of Portuguese by researchers in the industry or academia. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Human speech production, perception and communication

- NLP-oriented linguistic description or theoretical analysis

- Natural language processing tasks (e.g. parsing, word sense disambiguation, coreference resolution)

- Natural language processing applications (e.g. question answering, subtitling, summarization, sentiment analysis)

- Speech technologies (e.g. spoken language generation, speech and speaker recognition, spoken language understanding)

- Speech applications (e.g. spoken language interfaces, dialogue systems, speech-to-speech translation)

- Resources, standardization and evaluation (e.g. corpora, ontologies, lexicons, grammars)

- Language and speech processing in academic disciplines

- Portuguese language variants and dialect processing (including the language varieties of Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, East Timor, Galicia, Guinea-Bissau, Macao, Mozambique, Portugal, and Sao Tome and Principe)

Multilingual studies, methods, applications and resources including Portuguese





TRACKS



Considering the importance of language resources in the development and sustainability of language technologies, and the impact of natural language processing in the conception of innovative tools, services and applications, 



PROPOR will have for the first time two tracks dedicated to Linguistics and Resources and to Industry, apart from the traditional NLP research track (named ""General"").



""Linguistics and Resources"" track papers can describe work focusing on linguistic research and development activities leading to rich and innovative language resources usable and useful for NLP. This track is specifically designed for (but not limited to) papers describing:

- NLP-oriented linguistic description or theoretical analysis

- Resources, standardization and evaluation (e.g. corpora, ontologies, lexicons, grammars)



""Industry"" track papers can describe work on any topic listed above, focusing on research and development activities on language technologies framed by industrial and/or commercial settings and goals.





PROPOR 2022 will be held at the University of Fortaleza (Fortaleza - CE, Brazil) from March 21st to March 23rd. While we aim to host the conference in-person in Fortaleza, we are constantly monitoring the pandemic situation, and will provide suitable online options if needed.



PROPOR 2022 will be the 15th edition of the biennial PROPOR conference, hosted alternately in Brazil and in Portugal. Past meetings were held in Lisbon, PT (1993);  Curitiba, BR (1996);  Porto Alegre, BR (1998);  Évora, PT (1999);  Atibaia, BR (2000); Faro, PT (2003); Itatiaia, BR (2006); Aveiro, PT (2008); Porto Alegre, BR (2010);  Coimbra, PT (2012); São Carlos, BR (2014), Tomar, PT (2016), Canela, BR (2018) and Évora, PT (2020).

Text Mining and Applications (TEMA’15) Track of EPIA’15



TeMA 2015 will be held at the 17th Portuguese Conference on Artificial Intelligence (EPIA 2015) taking place at the University of Coimbra, Portugal, from 8th to 11th September 2015. This track is organized under the auspices of the Portuguese Association for Artificial Intelligence (APPIA).

[1] Track Description



Human languages are complex by nature and efforts in pure symbolic approaches alone have been unable to provide fully satisfying results. Text Mining and Machine Learning techniques applied to texts (raw or annotated) brought up new insights and completely shifted the approaches to Human Language Technologies. Both approaches, symbolic and statistically based, when duly integrated, have shown capabilities to bridge the gap between language theories and effective use of languages, and can enable important applications in real-world heterogeneous environment such as the Web.



The most natural form of written information is raw, unstructured text. The huge amount of this kind of textual information circulating in the Internet nowadays (in an increasing number of different languages) leads us to use and investigate systems, algorithms and models for mining texts. As a consequence, Text Mining is an active research area that is continuously broadening worldwide and fostering reinforced interest in languages other than the most common ones such as English, French, German and now Chinese. This 6th Biannual Track of Text Mining and Applications will provide, as in previous editions of the TeMA Tracks within the EPIA Conferences, a venue for researchers to present and share their work in intelligent computational technologies applied to written human languages. TeMA 2015 is a forum for researchers working in Human Language Technologies i.e. Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computational Linguistics (CL), Natural Language Engineering (NLE), Text Mining (TM) and related areas.



Authors are invited to submit their papers on any of the issues identified in section [2].Text Mining



[2] Topics of Interest



Topics include but are not limited to:



Text Mining:



- Language Models

- Multi-word Units

- Lexical Knowledge Acquisition

- Word and Multi-word Sense Disambiguation

- Acquisition and Usage of Language Resources

- Lexical Cohesion

- Sentiment Analysis

- Word and Multi-word Translation Extraction

- Textual Entailment

- Text Clustering and Classification

- Algorithms and Data Structures for Text Mining

- Multi-Faceted Text Analysis: Opinions, Time, Space

- Evaluation of all the previous



Applications:



- Social Network Analysis

- Machine Translation

- Automatic Summarization

- Information Extraction / Intelligent Information Retrieval

- Multilingual access to multilingual Information

- E-training, E-learning and Question-Answering Systems

- Web Mining



[3] Special Interests



The evolution of the Web has drastically changed the focus of Text Mining as most of the texts are small in size. While, in the past, the focus was on dealing with very large corpora of long texts, the new reality is huge collections of tweets or posts on social media that contain very few words in a clear multilingual environment. This is usually referred to the Big Data (here Big Textual Data). As a consequence, new trends have recently been appearing in Text Mining, for example, keyword extraction, named-entity recognition, novelty detection, event identification.



Moreover, the growing interest and quality of Wikipedia has allowed to include knowledge on a large scale in Text Mining applications. As such, a lot of research have been focusing on the correct use of knowledge bases, for example, entity information retrieval, word sense disambiguation, ephemeral clustering.

In natural languages, there are many ways to express complex human thoughts and ideas. This can be achieved by exploiting compositionality, i.e. concatenating simplex elements of language and thus yielding a more complex meaning that can be computed from the meaning of the original parts and the way they are combined. However, non-compositional phrases are also very frequent in any human language. These complex phrases can often be decomposed into single meaningful units, but the meaning of the whole phrase cannot (or can only partially) be computed from the meaning of its parts. Such phrases are often called multiword expressions (MWEs) and display lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and/or statistical idiosyncrasies (Baldwin & Kim 2010). In addition to idiomatic constructions, MWEs encompass closely related linguistic constructs such as light verb constructions, rhetorical figures and institutionalized phrases or collocations (Sag et al. 2002). MWEs pose problems for linguistic processing, especially in language learning and natural language processing (NLP), for instance, in machine translation, syntactic and semantic parsing, just to name a few applications. 



Researchers from several disciplines such as computer science, linguistics and psychology have been jointly working on MWE modeling and processing. For instance, designing guidelines for the annotation of MWEs in corpora, and prominently in treebanks, has been undertaken in various languages and linguistic frameworks (Rosén et al. 2015). Lexical resources with MWEs in dozens of languages exist and are still being developed (Losnegaard et al. 2016). Many papers describe methods to discover new MWEs in texts, applying a wide variety of tools and techniques such as association measures, distributional methods and machine learning. Interactions of MWE processing with deeper levels of linguistic analysis, notably parsing and semantic processing, are being increasingly investigated (e.g. in SEMEVAL 2016 task 10 - DiMSUM). Special issues on MWEs have been published by leading journals (CSL in 2005, LR&E in 2010, ACM TSLP in 2013). Several funded projects focusing on MWEs are indicative of the growing importance of the field within the NLP community. For instance, the EU H2020 program currently supports the COST Action PARSEME (2013-2017), that addresses the role of MWEs in parsing and gathers more than 200 researchers from 33 countries covering 30 languages. It also inspired several national spin-off projects on MWEs.



Many of these advances are described and published in the annual MWE workshop. It attracts the attention of an ever-growing community working on a variety of languages and linguistic phenomena. The workshop has been held since 2001 in conjunction with major computational linguistics conferences (ACL, COLING, LREC, EACL). It represents an important venue for the community to interact, share resources and tools, and collaborate on efforts for advancing the computational treatment of MWEs. 

We invite papers on major challenges in MWE processing, both from theoretical and computational viewpoints, focusing on research related (but not limited) to the following topics: 



Manually and automatically constructed lexical resources

MWE representation in lexical resources

MWE annotation in corpora and treebanks

MWEs in non-standard language (e.g. tweets, forums, spontaneous speech)

Original MWE discovery methods (e.g. using word embeddings, parallel corpora)

Original MWE in-context identification methods (e.g. using deep learning, topic models)

MWE processing in syntactic frameworks (e.g. HPSG, LFG, TAG, universal dependencies)

MWE processing in semantic frameworks (e.g. WSD, semantic parsing)

MWE processing in end-user applications (e.g. summarization, machine translation)

Orchestration of MWE processing with respect to applications

Evaluation of MWE processing techniques

Models of first and second language acquisition of MWEs

Theoretical and psycholinguistic studies on MWEs

Crosslinguistic studies on MWEs 



A volume with selected papers from the workshop is planned within the book series Phraseology and MultiWord Expressions that is the MWE-dedicated book series of Language Science Press.  



SPECIAL TRACK: Shared task on automatic identification of verbal MWEs



This year, there will be an extension to the traditional workshop: a special track for shared task papers. The shared task will compare and evaluate systems for the automatic identification of verbal MWEs in sentences. Participants will have the opportunity to submit shared task system description papers and present their approach and results at the workshop. For more details, see the separate call for shared task participation: http://multiword.sourceforge.net/sharedtask2017/



INVITED TALK

We are happy to announce that the invited talk of MWE 2017 will be given by Paul Cook (University of New Brunswick).



SUBMISSION MODALITIES 

The main track will feature long and short papers:

Long papers (8 content pages + references): Long papers should report on solid and finished research including new experimental results, resources and/or techniques.

Short papers (4 content pages + references): Short papers should report on small experiments, focused contributions, ongoing research, negative results and/or philosophical discussion.



The shared task track will feature system description papers:

System description papers (4 content pages + references): System description papers briefly describe the approach implemented to solve the problem. They may include references and links to more detailed descriptions in other documents.



There is no limit on the number of reference pages. Authors will be granted an extra page for the final version of their papers.



For the main track, submission will be double-blind, the reported research should be substantially original and the papers will be presented orally or as posters. The decision as to which papers will be presented orally and which as posters will be made by the program committee based on the nature rather than on the quality of the work.

The shared task system description papers will go through a separate reviewing process. Like in SEMEVAL, submissions will be double-blind and will be reviewed by the shared task organizers and participants according to the schedule below. The selected papers will be presented as posters. Participants of the shared task are not required to submit system description papers, and their acceptance depends on the quality of the paper rather than on the results obtained in the shared task.



All papers should use the EACL 2017 LaTeX templates and should be submitted via the START space. Please choose the appropriate submission type, according to the category of your paper. Final versions of accepted papers will be submitted both in PDF and source LaTeX formats.

NAACL HLT 2015 / SIGMT / SIGLEX Workshop

4 Jun 2015, Denver, Colorado



*** QTLeap Best Paper Award ***



The Nihth Workshop on Syntax, Semantics and Structure in Statistical Translation (SSST-9) seeks to bring together a large number of researchers working on diverse aspects of structure, semantics and representation in relation to statistical machine translation. Since its first edition in 2006, its program each year has comprised high-quality papers discussing current work spanning topics including: new grammatical models of translation; new learning methods for syntax- and semantics-based models; formal properties of synchronous/transduction grammars (hereafter S/TGs); discriminative training of models incorporating linguistic features; using S/TGs for semantics and generation; and syntax- and semantics-based evaluation of machine translation.



We invite two types of submissions spanning all areas of interest for SSST:



    Extended abstracts of at most two (2) pages, including position papers, recent work, pilot studies, negative results, etc. We encourage the presentation of relevant work that has been published or submitted elsewhere, as well as new work in progress.

    Regular full papers, describing novel contributions.



Full Papers



The need for structural mappings between languages is widely recognized in the fields of statistical machine translation and spoken language translation, and there is now wide consensus that these mappings are appropriately represented using a family of formalisms that includes synchronous/transduction grammars and similar notational equivalents. To date, flat-structured models, such as the word-based IBM models of the early 1990s or the more recent phrase-based models, remain widely used. But tree-structured mappings arguably offer a much greater potential for learning valid generalizations about relationships between languages.



Within this area of research there is a rich diversity of approaches. There is active research ranging from formal properties of S/TGs to large-scale end-to-end systems. There are approaches that make heavy use of linguistic theory, and approaches that use little or none. There is theoretical work characterizing the expressiveness and complexity of particular formalisms, as well as empirical work assessing their modeling accuracy and descriptive adequacy across various language pairs. There is work being done to invent better translation models, and work to design better algorithms. Recent years have seen significant progress on all these fronts. In particular, systems based on these formalisms are now top contenders in MT evaluations.



At the same time, SMT has seen a movement toward semantics over the past few years, which has been reflected at recent SSST workshops, including the last three editions which had semantics for SMT as a special theme. The issues of deep syntax and shallow semantics are closely linked and SSST-8 continues to encourage submissions on semantics for MT in a number of directions, including semantic role labeling, sense disambiguation, and compositional distributional semantics for translation and evaluation.



We invite full papers on:



    syntax-based / semantics-based / tree-structured SMT

    machine learning techniques for inducing structured translation models

    algorithms for training, decoding, and scoring with semantic representation structure

    empirical studies on adequacy and efficiency of formalisms

    creation and usefulness of syntactic/semantic resources for MT

    formal properties of synchronous/transduction grammars

    learning semantic information from monolingual, parallel or comparable corpora

    unsupervised and semi-supervised word sense induction and disambiguation methods for MT

    lexical substitution, word sense induction and disambiguation, semantic role labeling, textual entailment, paraphrase and other semantic tasks for MT

    semantic features for MT models (word alignment, translation lexicons, language models, etc.)

    evaluation of syntactic/semantic components within MT (task-based evaluation)

    scalability of structured translation methods to small or large data

    applications of S/TGs to related areas including:

        speech translation

        formal semantics and semantic parsing

        paraphrases and textual entailment

        information retrieval and extraction

    syntactically- and semantically-motivated evaluation of MT

    compositional distributional semantics in MT

    distributed representations and continuous vector space models in MT



Best Paper Award



This year SSST-9 will award a best paper award among papers which advance MT using semantics and deep language processing. This award is sponsored by the European Union QTLeap project.

We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all aspects of computational linguistics.



About COLING

The first COLING was held in New York in 1965, with the last iteration in Osaka in 2016. Throughout its history COLING has brought together researchers from across the field of Computational Linguistics.



With COLING 2018 we continue this tradition and welcome papers on all topics related to both natural language and contribution, with the expectation that all papers will include linguistic insight.



Towards the goal of attracting and selecting a high quality, diverse program, COLING 2018 invites papers of a broad variety of distinct types, detailed below.



Important Dates

Submission for mentoring: February 16, 2018

Final submissions due: March 16, 2018

Author feedback: April 20-24, 2018

Notifications: May 17, 2018

Main conference: August 22-25, 2018



Submission Instructions

We invite submissions of up to nine (9) pages maximum, plus bibliography. The COLING 2018 templates must be used; these will be provided in LaTeX and also Microsoft Word format. Submissions will only be accepted in PDF format. Deviations from the provided templates should result in rejections without review. Submit papers by the end of the deadline day via our softconf site; the timezone is UTC-12.



Types of Paper

We invite papers in the following categories, each of which is associated with a distinct review form.



COMPUTATIONALLY-AIDED LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS

The focus of this paper type is new linguistic insight. Originality could be in the linguistic question being addressed, in the methodology applied to the linguistic question, or in the combination of the two. It should be shown how results generalize, either by deepening our understanding of some linguistic system in general or by demonstrating methodology that can be applied to other problems.



NLP ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT PAPER

This type of paper tests a hypothesis about the effectiveness of a technique for a task. The hypothesis should be clearly stated, the testing methodology rigorous, and the experiment reproducible. Furthermore, a successful COLING paper of this type will include thoughtful error analysis and a clear explanation of how the results in the experiment relate to the hypothesis.



REPRODUCTION PAPER

The contribution of a reproduction paper lies in analyses of and in insights into existing methods and problems—plus the added certainty that comes with validating previous results or the information that certain results are not reproducible. A strong reproduction paper offers analysis and deepens our understanding of the methodology used or problem approached, helping practitioners choose techniques / resources.



RESOURCE PAPER

Papers in this track present a new language resource. This could be a corpus, but also could be an annotation standard, tool, and so on. Part of the contribution of a reproduction paper lies in the quality, accessibility and description of resources.



POSITION PAPER

A position paper presents a challenge to conventional thinking or a futuristic new vision. It could open up a new area or spur the development of novel technology, propose changes in existing research practices, or give a new set of ground rules. Creative and sound positions will do best, with well-defined visions opening up new areas of research.



SURVEY PAPER

A survey paper provides a structured overview of the literature to date on a specific topic that helps the reader understand the kinds of questions being asked about the topic, the various approaches that have been applied, how they relate to each other, and what further research areas they open up. A conference-length survey paper should be about a sufficiently focused topic that it can do this successfully with in the page limits.



Author Responsibilities

Papers must be of original, previously-unpublished work. The formatting template must be strictly adhered to and deadlines met. Papers must be anonymized to support double-blind reviewing. If the paper is available as a preprint, this must be indicated in the submission form but not in the paper itself.  In addition, COLING 2018 will follow the same policy as ACL 2018 establishing an anonymity period (February 16-author notification) during which non-anonymous posting of preprints is not allowed. Also included in that policy are instructions to reviewers to not rate papers down for not citing recent preprints.



Papers that have been or will be under consideration for other venues at the same time must indicate this at submission time. If a paper is accepted for publication at COLING, it must be immediately withdrawn from other venues. If a paper under review at COLING is accepted elsewhere and authors intend to proceed there, the COLING committee must be notified immediately.



Multilingual Abstracts/Synopses

For the camera-ready papers, we will invite authors to provide a translation of the title and abstract and a 1-2 page synopsis of the paper in a second language of the authors’ choice.  Appropriate languages include but are not limited to authors’ native languages, languages spoken in the authors’ place of affiliation, and languages that are the focus of the research presented.



Writing Mentoring Program

COLING 2018 is offering a writing mentoring program. Authors wishing to participate must submit an abstract by February 16, 2018 and a complete draft of their paper by February 23, 2018. Further information is available at: http://coling2018.org/writing-mentoring-program/

We strongly recommend the use of LNCS LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word templates available on the LNCS websites. Manuscripts should be submitted electronically through the submission website (https://www.softconf.com/e/nlpcc2015). Email submissions will not be considered.



¤ Double-Blind Reviewing : 

Anonymity Requirements for Double-Blind Reviewing: 

Every research paper submitted to NLPCC 2015 will undergo a ""double-blind"" reviewing process: the PC members and referees who review the paper will not know the identity of the authors. To ensure anonymity of authorship, authors must prepare their manuscript as follows:

1. Authors' names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.

2. Funding sources must not be acknowledged on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.

3. Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper.

4. The paper's file name must not identify the authors of the paper. It is strongly suggested that the submitted file be named with the assigned submission number.

5. You must also use care in referring to related past work, particularly your own, in the paper. For example, if you are Jane Smith, the following text gives away the authorship of the submitted paper:

In our previous work [1,2], we presented two algorithms for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ...

Bibliography

[1] Jane Smith, ""A Simple Algorithm for ...,"" Proceedings of ACL 2007, pp. 1-8.

[2] Jane Smith, ""A More Complicated Algorithm for ...,"" Proceedings of ACL 2008, pp.33-40.

The solution is to reference your past work in the third person (just as you would any other piece of work that is related to the submitted paper). This allows you to set the context for the submitted paper, while at the same time preserving anonymity:

In previous work [1,2], algorithms were presented for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ...

Bibliography

[1] Jane Smith, ""A Simple Algorithm for ...,"" Proceedings of ACL 2007, pp. 1-8.

[2] Jane Smith, ""A More Complicated Algorithm for ...,"" Proceedings of ACL 2008, pp.33-40.

It is the responsibility of authors to do their very best to preserve anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to immediate rejection.

CALL FOR PAPERS

=======================



The 13th Linguistic Annotation Workshop (The LAW XIII)

https://sigann.github.io/LAW-XIII-2019



Held in conjunction with ACL 2019, Florence/Italy, August 2019

Sponsored by the ACL Special Interest Group on Annotation (SIGANN)







WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION

========================



Linguistic annotation of natural language corpora is the backbone of supervised methods for statistical natural language processing. It also provides valuable data for evaluation of both rule-based and supervised systems and can help formalize and study linguistic phenomena.



The LAW provides a forum for presentation and discussion of innovative research on all aspects of linguistic annotation, including creation/evaluation of annotation schemes, methods for automatic and manual annotation, use and evaluation of annotation software and frameworks, representation of linguistic data and annotations, evaluation of manual and automatically-produced annotations, etc.





SPECIAL THEME

=======================

We encourage submission of papers relating to this year's special theme: ***marking of information quality in discourse***, i.e., annotations that mark how the speaker/writer expresses assessments. These assessments may be explicit and/or implicit in discourse, and may reflect positions, beliefs, opinions, appraisals and/or assessments about written or spoken propositions, for example, how a politician shows in discourse the degree of truthfulness in one of his/her electoral promises, or how a reporter shows his/her degree of belief in what the politician stated. This might include the annotation of devices such as hedges (“Donald claims that the crowd size, if you can really trust him to measure it, was enormous.”), committed belief (“The winners of the contest will be announced tomorrow.“) or attitudes (“It is with great sadness that we have learnt about the death of 6 people in the accident.”).





WORKSHOP TOPICS

=======================

We welcome submissions of long and short papers, posters, and demonstrations, relating to the topics of the special theme and to any aspect of linguistic annotation, including:



== Annotation procedures ==

- Innovative automated and manual strategies for annotation.

- Machine learning and knowledge-based methods for automation of corpus annotation.

- Creation, maintenance, and interactive exploration of annotation structures and annotated data.



== Annotation evaluation ==

- Inter-annotator agreement and other evaluation metrics and strategies.

- Qualitative evaluation of linguistic representation.



== Annotation access and use ==

- Representation formats/structures for merged annotations of different phenomena, and means to explore/manipulate them.

- Linguistic considerations for merging annotations of distinct phenomena.



== Annotation schemes, guidelines and standards ==

- New and innovative annotation schemes, comparison of annotation schemes.

- Best practices for annotation procedures and/or development and documentation of annotation schemes.

- Interoperability of annotation formats and/or frameworks among different systems as well as different tasks, frameworks, modalities, and languages.

- Results on the application and evaluation of standards for (linguistic) annotation.



== Annotation software and frameworks ==

- Development, evaluation and/or innovative use of annotation software frameworks.





SUBMISSIONS and REVIEWING

=========================



Submissions should report original and unpublished research on topics of interest for the workshop. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop, and will be published in the workshop proceedings. They should emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results.



A paper accepted for presentation at the workshop must not be or have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings.



Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system. The submission site will be announced shortly.



Long/short paper submissions must use the official ACL 2019 style templates. Long papers must not exceed eight (8) pages of content. Short papers and demonstration papers must not exceed four (4) pages of content. References do not count against these limits.



Note: The supplementary material does not count towards page limit and should not be included in paper, but should be submitted separately using the appropriate field on the submission website.

All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to the official style guidelines, which are contained in the template files that will become available on the conference website shortly.



Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore, the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations or self-references that reveal the authors’ identity, e.g., ""We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."" should be replaced with citations such as ""Smith (1991) previously showed ..."". Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

Authors of papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must provide this information to the workshop co-chairs. Authors of accepted papers must notify the program chairs within 10 days of acceptance if the paper is withdrawn for any reason.



If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the program co-chairs (law-xiii-2019-chairs@googlegroups.com).

Introduction

The increasing accessibility of large legal corpora and databases create opportunities to develop data driven techniques as well as more advanced tools that can facilitate multiple tasks of researchers and practitioners in the legal domain. While recent advancements in the areas of data mining and machine learning have gained many applications in domains such as biomedical, healthcare and finance, there is still a noticeable gap in how much the state-of-the-art techniques are being incorporated in the legal domain. Achieving this goal entails building a multi-disciplinary community that can benefit from the competencies of both law and computer science experts. The goal of this workshop is to bring the researchers and practitioners of both disciplines together and provide an opportunity to share the latest novel research findings and innovative approaches in employing data analytics and machine learning in the legal domain.

Special Issue on Applications of Speech and Language Technologies in

Healthcare



https://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci/special_issues/speech_language_technologies_healthcare



Speech and language technologies (SLTs) have experienced a major boom

in recent years and commercial speech-enabled systems are becoming

ubiquitous. Unfortunately, people with speech and language impairments

often face barriers to using these technologies leading to an

increasing gap between SLTs available to the general public and those

accessible to people with speech impairments. Other applications of

SLTs include assistive communication devices for people with speech

impairments, speech-based diagnosis of certain voice and respiratory

pathologies (e.g., dysphonia, vocal fold nodules, COVID-19, etc.) and,

even, certain neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's or

Parkinson's disease. In addition, new communication interfaces with

great potential are emerging, such as silent speech interfaces.



In this Special Issue, we attempt to collect relevant contributions in

the development of SLTs focused on improving the integration of people

with speech impairments in society, as well as for the detection and

monitoring of pathologies or diseases. We also intend to attract

studies on the development of applications for voice professionals in

the clinical field.



We cordially invite you to participate in this special issue by

submitting your recent work on the field. Relevant research topics

include, but are not limited to:

- Speech and language technologies for augmentative and alternative communication (AAC);

- Silent speech interfaces;

- Voice conversion (VC) and text-to-speech (TTS) assistive communication systems;

- Automatic speech recognition for people with speech impairments;

- Diagnosis and monitoring of voice disorders and other respiratory diseases;

- Speech-based diagnosis and assessment of neurological disorders;

- Personalization of speech tools for people with speech impairments;

- Voice banking initiatives;

- Tools and software for speech therapists and clinicians.

Detailed call for papers:



** Introduction **



In addition to the long-standing challenge faced by scholars of keeping up with the growing literature in their own and related fields, they must now compete with malign pseudo-science and dis-information in informing public policy and behavior. This has stimulated workshops and research focused on enhancing search, retrieval, summarization, and analysis of scholarly documents. However, the general research community on scholarly document processing remains fragmented, and efforts towards natural language understanding of scholarly text that is central to vastly improve all the said downstream applications are not widespread. 



To address these gaps, we propose the first Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing.

We seek to reach to the broader NLP and AI/ML community to pool the distributed efforts to improve scholarly document understanding and enable intelligent access to the published research. The goal of SDP is two-fold: to increase collaboration between communities interested in leveraging knowledge stored in scholarly literature and data, and to establish SDP as the single-focused primary venue for the field.



We seek to appeal to the mainstream NLP and ML community working on SDP tasks – which are NLP tasks – to publish at SDP as we seek to establish SDP as the integrated premier venue. We have established a steering committee (https://ornlcda.github.io/SDProc/steeringcommittee.html) to help us turn SDP into a conference in the forthcoming years.



** Topics of Interest **



We invite submissions from all communities interested in natural language processing, information retrieval, and data mining problems in scholarly documents; and in processing scholarly documents for easier access to various audiences. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:



* Information extraction, text mining and parsing scholarly literature

* Reproducibility and peer review

* Lay summarization (i.e., summaries created for non-experts) of individual and collections of scholarly documents

* Discourse modeling and argument mining 

* Summarization and question-answering for scholarly documents

* Semantic and network-based indexing, search and navigation in structured text

* Graph analysis/mining including citation and co-authorship networks

* Analysing and mining of citation contexts for document understanding and retrieval 

* New scholarly language resources and evaluation

* Connecting and interlinking publications, data, tweets, blogs or their parts

* Disambiguation, metadata extraction, enrichment, and data quality assurance for scholarly documents

* Bibliometrics, scientometrics, and altmetrics approaches and applications

* Other aspects of scholarly workflows including open access/science, and research assessment

* Infrastructures for accessing scholarly publications and/or research data



** The 6th Computational Linguistics Scientific Document Summarization Shared Task (CL-SciSumm 2020) ** 

(Organisers: Muthu Kumar Chandrasekaran)



CL-SciSumm is the first medium-scale shared task on scientific document summarization, with over 500 annotated documents. Last year's CL-SciSumm shared task introduced large scale training datasets, both annotated from ScisummNet and auto-annotated. For the task, Systems were provided with a Reference Paper (RP) and 10 or more Citing Papers (CPs) that all contain citations to the RP, which they used to summarise RP. This was evaluated against abstract and human written summaries on ROUGE. 



The task is defined as follows:

* Given: A topic consisting of a Reference Paper (RP) and Citing Papers (CPs) that all contain citations to the RP. In each CP, the text spans (i.e., citances) have been identified that pertain to a particular citation to the RP.

* Task 1A: For each citance, identify the spans of text (cited text spans) in the RP that most accurately reflect the citance. These are of the granularity of a sentence fragment, a full sentence, or several consecutive sentences (no more than 5).

* Task 1B: For each cited text span, identify what facet of the paper it belongs to, from a predefined set of facets.

* Task 2 (optional bonus task): Finally, generate a structured summary of the RP from the cited text spans of the RP. The length of the summary should not exceed 250 words.

This year, CL-SciSumm '20 will have two new tracks: LaySumm and LongSumm.



** CL-LaySumm 2020: The 1st Computational Linguistics Lay Summary Challenge Shared Task ** 

(Organisers: Anita De Waard, Ed Hovy)



To ensure and increase the relevance of science for all of society and not just a small group of niche practitioners, researchers have been increasingly tasked by funders and publishers to outline the scope of their research for the general public by writing a summary for a lay audience, or lay summary. The LaySumm summarization task considers automating this responsibility, by enabling systems to automatically generate lay summaries. A lay summary explains, succinctly and without using technical jargon, what the overall scope, goal and potential impact of a scholarly paper is.



The corpus for this task will comprise full-text papers with lay summaries, in a variety of domains, and from a number of journals. Elsevier will make available a collection of lay summaries from a multidisciplinary collection of journals, as well as the abstracts and full text of these journals.



The task is defined as follows:

* Given: A full-text paper, its abstract, and a lay summary of a given paper

* Task: For each paper, generate a lay summary of the specified length



Evaluation



The Lay Summary Task will be scored by using several ROUGE metrics to compare the system output and the gold standard lay summary. As a follow-up to the intrinsic evaluation, we will crowdsource a number of automatically generated lay summaries to a panel of judges and a lay audience. Details of the crowdsourcing evaluation will be announced with the sharing of the final test corpus on July 1st.



All nominated entries will be invited to publish a paper in Open Access (Author-Payment Charges will be waived) in a selected Elsevier publication. Authors will be asked to provide an automatically generated lay summary of their paper, together with their contribution.



** LongSumm 2020: Shared Task on Generating Long Summaries for Scientific Documents ** 

(Organisers: Michal Shmueli-Scheuer, Guy Feigenblat) 



Most of the work on scientific document summarization focuses on generating relatively short summaries (250 words or less). While such a length constraint can be sufficient for summarizing news articles, it is far from sufficient for summarizing scientific work. In fact, such a short summary resembles more to an abstract than to a summary that aims to cover all the salient information conveyed in a given text. Writing such summaries requires expertise and a deep understanding in a scientific domain, as can be found in some researchers’ blogs.



The LongSumm task opted to leverage blogs created by researchers in the NLP and Machine learning communities and use these summaries as reference summaries to compare the submissions against.



The corpus for this task includes a training set that consists of 1705 extractive summaries and around 700 abstractive summaries of NLP and Machine Learning scientific papers. These are drawn from papers based on video talks from associated conferences (Lev et al. 2019 TalkSumm) and from blogs created by NLP and ML researchers. In addition, we create a test set of abstractive summaries. Each submission is judged against one reference summary (gold summary) on ROUGE and should not exceed 600 words.



** Submission Information ** 



Authors are invited to submit full and short papers with unpublished, original work. Submissions will be subject to a double-blind peer review process. Accepted papers will be presented by the authors at the workshop either as a talk or a poster. All accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings.

3rd Conference on Automated Knowledge Base Construction (AKBC)



October 4-7, 2021, Monday-Thursday (held virtually)



Homepage: http://www.akbc.ws



Email: info@akbc.ws





Key dates



Paper submission deadline: Thursday, June 17, 2021



Notification of acceptance: Wednesday, July 30, 2021



Conference & Workshop Dates: Monday-Thursday, October 4-7, 2021





Knowledge Base Construction





Knowledge gathering, representation, and reasoning are among the fundamental challenges of artificial intelligence.  Large-scale repositories of knowledge about entities, relations, and their abstractions are known as “knowledge bases”.  Most major technology companies now have substantial efforts in knowledge base construction. Related scholarly work spans many research areas, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, information integration, databases, search, data mining, knowledge representation, human computation, human-computer interfaces, and fairness.  The AKBC conference serves as a research forum for gathering all these areas, in both academia and industry.





About the Conference





Nearly a decade after the first AKBC workshop in Grenoble, France, 2010, AKBC became a conference in 2019. Why a stand-alone conference?



Long-standing and growing interest in the area.



We want to grow and connect the community beyond existing individual conference communities, bringing together ML, NLP, DB, IR, KRR, semantics, reasoning, common sense, QA, human computation, dialog, and HCI.



We want to set our own culture, including reviewing practices, and meeting format.



Why now?  Growing interest across many areas.  Disconnect among multiple relevant communities.  Growing industry and government interest.  Many of the long-existing conferences have grown uncomfortably large; a new, smaller conference can be more intimate, hospitable, and supportive.





Call For Papers



We invite the submission of papers describing previously unpublished research, including new methodology, datasets, evaluations, surveys, reproduced results, negative results, and visionary positions.





Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:



Natural language processing, information extraction, extraction of entities, relations, and events, semantic parsing, coreference, machine reading, entailment, web mining, multilingual NLP.



Information integration, entity resolution, schema & ontology alignment, text and structure alignment, federated KBs, Semantic Web.



Machine learning, supervised, unsupervised, lightly-supervised and distantly-supervised learning, deep learning, symbolic learning, multimodal learning, embeddings of knowledge.



Search, question-answering, reasoning, knowledge base completion, queries on mixtures of structured and unstructured data; querying under uncertainty.



Multi-modal knowledge bases: structured data, text, images, video, audio.



Human-computer interaction, crowdsourcing, interactive learning.



Fairness, accountability, transparency, misinformation, multiple viewpoints, uncertainty.



Databases, probabilistic databases, distributed databases, database cleaning, scalable computation, distributed computation, dynamic data, online adaptation of knowledge.



Systems, languages and toolkits, demonstrations of existing knowledge bases.



Evaluation of AKBC, datasets, evaluation methodology.





Authors of accepted papers will have the option for their conference paper to be archival (with full text in AKBC Proceedings, and be considered for best paper awards) or non-archival (listed in AKBC Conference schedule, with full text in OpenReview, and the flexibility to also submit elsewhere).  Double-blind reviewing will be performed on the OpenReview platform, with papers, reviews and comments publicly visible.





Papers should be restricted to 10 single-column pages, excluding references. Submission site: http://www.akbc.ws/2021/submission.





Dual Submission Policy: Submissions that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, are not allowed and violate our dual submission policy.  However, papers that cite previous related work by the authors and papers that have appeared on non-peered reviewed websites (like arXiv) or that have been presented at workshops (i.e., venues that do not have publication proceedings) do not violate the policy. The policy is enforced during the whole reviewing process.

You are invited to participate in the 4th Joint Workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced IR and NLP for Digital Libraries (BIRNDL), to be held as part of 42nd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2019) in Paris, France on 25th July 2019.

(http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~birndl2019/).  



This is the 4th BIRNDL workshop, third at SIGIR, following a series of successful BIR workshops at ECIR and other premier IR venues. In conjunction with the BIRNDL workshop, we will also hold the 5th CL-SciSumm Shared Task in Scientific Document Summarization. (http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cl-scisumm2019).



BIRNDL is sponsored by SRI International and Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative.



=== Important Dates ===

- Submissions deadline: May 3, 2019

- Notification: May 31, 2019

- Camera Ready Contributions: July 7, 2019

- Workshop: July 25, 2019 in Paris, France



=== Aim of the Workshop ===

The goal of the BIRNDL workshop at SIGIR 2019 is to engage the IR community in the open problems in Big Science. Big Science refers to the large, cross-domain digital repositories which index research papers, such as the ACL Anthology, ArXiv, ACM Digital Library, PubMed, IEEE database, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Currently, digital libraries collect and allow access to digital papers and their metadata---inclusive of citations---but mostly do not analyze the items they index. The scale of growth in scholarly publishing poses a challenge for scholars in their search for relevant literature. Finding relevant scholarly literature is the key focus of the workshop and sets the agenda for methods and approaches to be discussed and evaluated at BIRNDL.



We invite papers that draw on insights from IR, bibliometrics and NLP to develop new methods to open problems in Big Science, such as evidence-based searching, measurement of research quality, relevance and impact, the emergence and decline of research problems, identification of scholarly relationships and influences and applied problems such as language translation, question-answering and summarization.



For your reference: Proceedings of the third BIRNDL workshop at SIGIR 2018 (http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2132/)and a recent report in SIGIR Forum (http://sigir.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/p105.pdf).



=== Workshop Topics ===

By design, BIRNDL is an inclusive and diverse venue, in terms of both constituency and research. To promote a diverse constituency, we explicitly encourage female first authors. We invite stimulating research on topics including, but not limited to, full-text analysis, including multilingual analysis, IR methods for DL, and applications of citation-based NLP. Specific examples of fields of interest include



- Infrastructure for scientific mining and IR,

- Semantic and Network-based indexing, navigation, searching and browsing in structured data,

- Discourse structure identification and argument mining from scientific papers,

- Summarisation and question-answering for scholarly DLs,

- Bibliometrics, citation analysis and network analysis for IR,

- Recommendation for scholarly papers, reviewers, citations and publication venues,

- Measurement and evaluation of quality and impact,

- Information extraction and parsing tasks in scientific papers,

- Science knowledge base population (Sci-KBP) and inference,

- Automated discovery and maintenance of metadata and controlled vocabularies,

- Disambiguation issues in scholarly DLs.



Importantly, to address the scarcity of validated datasets in this area, we also invite papers describing new and pre-existing datasets. Submissions in this track will include instructions for accessing the data; metadata and documentation on its organization, content, and quality; and descriptions of possible use cases. We also invite descriptions of running projects and ongoing work as well as contributions from industry. Papers that investigate multiple themes are welcome.



=== The CL-SciSumm Shared Task ===



CL-SciSumm19 is expected to be of interest to a broad community including those working in computational linguistics and natural language processing, text summarization, discourse structure in scholarly discourse, paraphrase, textual entailment and text simplification. The task constitutes automatic scientific paper summarization in the Computational Linguistics (CL) domain. The output summaries will be of two types: faceted summaries of the traditional self-summary (the abstract) and the community summary (the collection of citation sentences ‘citances’). We also propose to group the citances by the facets of the text that they refer to.



At SIGIR 2019, we will hold the 5th Computational Linguistics (CL) Scientific Summarization Shared Task http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cl-scisumm2019 which is sponsored by SRI International and Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI). This task follows up on the successful CL-SciSumm-2018 @ SIGIR 2018 and three previous editions. In this task, a training corpus of 40 manually annotated topics and 1000 auto-annotated from CL research papers are released. Participants are invited to enter their systems in a task-based evaluation on a blind test set.



=== Submission Information ===

- Main track: All submissions must be written in English, following the Springer LNCS author guidelines (max. 6 pages for short and 12 pages for full papers; exclusive of unlimited pages for references) and should be submitted as PDF files to EasyChair (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=birndl2019). All submissions will be reviewed by at least two independent reviewers. Please be aware of the fact that at least one author per paper needs to register for the workshop and attend the workshop to present the work. In case of no-show the paper (even if accepted) will be deleted from the proceedings and from the program submissions and reviewing will be managed by the EasyChair conference management system.



- Poster track: We welcome submissions detailing original, early findings, works in progress and industrial applications of bibliometrics and IR for a special poster session, possibly with a 2-minute presentation in the main session. Some research track papers will also be invited to the poster track instead, although there will be no difference in the final proceedings between poster and research track submissions. These papers should follow the same format as the research track papers.



- The CL-SciSumm Shared Task: Teams that wish to participate in the CL Shared Task track at BIRNDL 2019 are invited to register on EasyChair with a title and a tentative abstract describing their approach at



(https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=clscisumm2019). Participants are advised to register as soon as possible in order to receive timely access to evaluation resources, including development and testing data. Registration for the task does not commit you to participation - but is helpful to know for planning. All participants who submit system runs are welcome to present their system at the BIRNDL Workshop in the poster session, while the best performing system will be invited to present their paper in the main session. Dissemination of CL-SciSumm work and results other than in the workshop proceedings is welcomed, but the conditions of participation specifically preclude any advertising claims based on these results. Any questions about conference participation may be sent to the organizers mentioned below.

Social networks, dynamic structures comprised of individuals or organizations, have always played a major role in our societies. They have evolved and diversified with the Web 2.0, which offers users the possibility to create and share content through multiple platforms (blogs, micro-blogs, wikis, sharing sites, etc.). In this environment, the unprecedented volume and variety of textual data as well as the users? interaction network give rise to new opportunities to better understand social behavior. The study of messages exchanged represents a new challenge in Natural Language Processing. In this context, it becomes interesting to discuss the strength of NLP methods (morphosyntactic analysers, systems of term extraction and of named entity recognition, etc.) on this data. In this special issue, new approaches will be presented for the purpose of analysing this massive, heterogeneous and usually noisy textual data coming from social networks.



In addition, these means of communication are powerful collective tools where language is both invented and experienced with. Certain words are then attributed new meanings, and the creation of words or new syntactic structures becomes widespread (for example, by mixing different languages). The creation, dissemination and processing of this original vocabulary can be discussed in this special issue, which, in a broader perspective, will highlight a new way to communicate.



Some metadata (for example, the hashtags) and the linguistic descriptors originating from texts constitute a solid base for the analysis of social networks. They bring to the fore different socio-economic, political and geographic communities, just to name a few. In addition, the linguistic descriptors, whether they are words or syntagmatic relations, allow for a precise analysis of the feelings and opinions contained in the messages. For example, the lexical, graphic and even syntactic specificities (emoticons, abbreviations, character repetition, etc.) in the text data contain valuable information allowing for the detection of opinions or analysis of feelings (fine detection of emotions, identification of irony, etc.).



Finally, this special issue will be an opportunity to describe new problems arising from social networks development. For example, systems that monitor social networks must be able to detect potential usurpers or study the dissemination of information. This special issue offers the opportunity to present original applications adapted to the processing of textual data that stems from social networks.



Non-exhaustive list of topics covered in this special issue:

- Creation of resources (corpus, dictionaries, etc.) from social networks;

- Syntactic analysis of non-structured written material;

- Identification of named entities arising from new means of communication;

- Generation of words/phrases and language dynamism;

- Multilingualism and mixed languages;

- Categorization and grouping of textual data from social networks (communities, thematics, profiles, etc);

- Detection of weak signals in social networks;

- Spreading of content and linguistic practices;

- Sentiment analysis/opinion mining;

- Contextual interpretation of the content of social networks;

- Extraction and indexing of textual information in social networks;

- Evaluation and quality of data generated from social networks;

- Monitoring systems;

- E-reputation;

- Detection of usurpers and avatars;

- Speech and dialogs analysis;

- Summary of activities in the networks.

September 14-16, 2016 – University of Salamanca (Spain)



http://www.congresocedi.es/sepln





INTRODUCTION

-----------------------

The 32nd. Edition of the International Conference of the Spanish Society for Natural Language Processing (SEPLN) will take place at the University of Salamanca (Salamanca, Spain) on 14-16 September 2016. The SEPLN 2016 will be held in conjunction with CEDI 2016 (http://www.congresocedi.es/).



The huge amount of information available in digital format and in different languages calls for systems to enable us to access this vast library in an increasingly more structured way. In this same area, there is a renewed interest in improving the information accessibility and information exploitation in multilingual environments. Most of the formal foundations for dealing appropriately with these necessities have been, and are still being, established in the area of Natural Language Processing and its many branches: Information extraction and retrieval, Questions answering systems, Machine translation, Automatic analysis of textual content, Text summarization, Text generation, and Speech recognition and synthesis.



The aim of the conference is to provide a forum for discussion and communication where the latest research work and developments in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be presented by scientific and business communities. The conference also aims at exposing new possibilities of real applications and R&D projects in this field.



Moreover, as in previous editions, there is the intention of identifying future guidelines or paths for basic research and foreseen software applications, in order to compare them against the market needs. Finally, the conference intends to be an appropriate forum in helping new professionals to become active members in this field.



This year we will organise a Doctoral Symposium. It will provide doctoral students investigating topics in natural language processing with a unique opportunity to have interaction with other researchers and receive feedback regarding their proposed research.

The MUMTTT workshop will be held on the last day of the Europhras’2019 conference, namely on  27th  September 2019. It will provide a forum for researchers and practitioners in the  fields of (Computational) Linguistics, (Computational) Phraseology, Translation Studies and Translation Technology to discuss recent advances in the area of multi-word unit processing and to coordinate research efforts across disciplines in order to improve the integration of multi-word units in machine translation and translation technology tools.

Multi-word units are word combinations which range from compounds such as ‘credit card’ to idiomatic expressions such as “’it is raining cats and dogs’ and are acknowledged as one of the major challenges in natural language processing (NLP), because of their lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and/or statistical idiosyncracies.

In spite of the relative progress achieved in translation technology with the adoption of neural approaches and in the processing for particular types of units such as verb-particle constructions, the identification, interpretation and translation of multi-word units in general still represent open challenges, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view. The idiosyncratic morpho-syntactic, semantic and translational properties of multi-word units pose many obstacles even to human translators, mainly because of intrinsic ambiguities, structural and lexical asymmetries between languages, and, finally, cultural differences.

In recent years, growing attention has been paid to integrating multi-word units (MWUs) in machine translation and translation technology tools, as it has been acknowledged that it is not possible to create large scale language solutions without properly handling MWUs of all types. As a matter of fact, researchers are now addressing the problems posed by MWU processing and translation using different formalisms and techniques, such as automatic recognition of MWUs in a monolingual or bilingual setting; alignment and paraphrasing techniques; development and use of (handcrafted) monolingual and bilingual language resources; creation of annotated monolingual and parallel corpora, development of strategies for handling syntactically flexible units in language analysis and translation modules, development of evaluation projects. The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners working on MWU processing from various perspectives, in order to enable cross-fertilisation and foster the creation of innovative solutions that can only arise from interdisciplinary collaborations. In particular, the workshop welcomes interactions between NLP researchers working on the computational treatment of multi-word units, experts in (computational) phraseology working on challenging topics of their discipline, as well as translation practitioners, to the benefit of applying their latest results to advance the state of the art in MWU processing.

Topics of Interest

The MUMTTT 2019 workshop invites the submission of papers reporting on original and unpublished research on topics related to MWU processing in machine translation and translation technology, including:

- Lexical, syntactic, semantic and translational aspects in MWU representation

- Theoretical approaches to MWUs (e.g., collostructional analysis of MWU, cognitive approaches to processing MWUs, etc.)

- Development of multilingual MWU resources

-Identification and acquisition of MWUs and variants

-Learning semantic information about MWUs from monolingual, parallel or comparable corpora

-Development and use of MWU resources in machine translation and translation technology

-Development of corpora for the extraction and translation of MWUs

-Compilation of resources for the extraction and translation of multiword units

-Creation of MWU-annotated corpora with a focus on translation aspects

-Paraphrasing of MWUs applied to the improvement of machine translation

-MWUs and word alignment techniques

-MWUs in machine translation

-MUWs in translation memory systems

-MUWs in term extraction

-MWU-centred machine translation evaluation

-Evaluation of MWU translation

Submissions



Submissions should describe original, unpublished work. Papers presented at EMNLP should mainly contain new material that has not been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings. Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must disclose this information at submission time. Please list all other meetings where the paper has been submitted in the “other submissions” field on the submission site (and see below for details of the multiple submission policy).



Each long paper submission consists of a paper of up to nine (9) pages of content and any number of additional pages containing references only, together with optional supplementary material as described below.



EMNLP 2014 also solicits short papers. Characteristics of short papers include:



    A small, focused contribution

    Work in progress

    A negative result

    An opinion piece

    An interesting application nugget 



Short papers will be presented orally or as a poster (at the discretion of the programme chairs), and will be given four (4) pages plus 2 pages for references in the proceedings. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers presented orally or as posters. Each short paper submission will be reviewed by at least two programme committee members.



Both long and short papers should follow the two-column format of NAACL 2014 proceedings. Please use the official NAACL 2013 style files for the paper (and ensure that your paper is Letter size). We reserve the right to reject submissions if the paper does not conform to these styles, including letter size and font size restrictions



As reviewing will be blind, the submission should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...”, should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith (1991) previously showed ...”. Submissions that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. Separate author identification information is required as part of the on-line submission process.



The supplementary material should be supplementary (rather than central) to the paper. It may include explanations or details of proofs or derivations that do not fit into the paper, lists of features or feature templates, sample inputs and outputs for a system, pseudo-code or source code, and data. The paper should not rely on the supplementary material: while the paper may refer to and cite the supplementary material and the supplementary material will be available to reviewers, they will not be asked to review or even download the supplementary material.



Submission and reviewing will be on-line, managed by the START system. The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. The supplementary material must be in the form of a single .zip or a .tgz archive file with a maximum size of 10MB; otherwise there are no constraints on its format. Submissions, together with all supplementary material, must be uploaded to the START system by the submission deadlines; submissions submitted after that time will not be reviewed. To minimise network congestion we request authors upload their submissions as early as possible (especially if they contain large supplementary material files)."

(Third Workshop on Logics and Ontologies)

(First Workshop on Lexical Semantics for Lesser-Resourced Languages)



13th July 2016

Tomar, Portugal (co-located with PROPOR2016)





Aims and Scope:



Lexical semantics continues to play an important role in driving research directions in NLP, with the recognition and understanding of context becoming increasingly important in delivering successful outcomes in NLP tasks. Areas such as word sense and named entity disambiguation, coreference resolution and the creation and maintenance of dictionaries, annotated corpora and resources have been the cornerstones of lexical semantics research and produced a wealth of contextual information that NLP processes can exploit. New efforts both to link and construct from scratch such information - as Linked Open Data or by way of formal tools coming from logic, ontologies and automated reasoning - have increased the interoperability and accessibility of resources for NLP, lexical semantics and computational semantics in general - even in those languages for which they have previously been limited.



LexSem-Logics 2016 combines the 1st Workshop on Lexical Semantics for Lesser-Resources Languages and the 3rd Workshop on Logics and Ontologies. Its aim is to bring together researchers interested in a range of topics across these two areas – advances in the recognition and disambiguation of lexical semantic units, exploiting new or existing tools for resolving lexical semantic issues in NLP, formal approaches on dealing with semantics, the combination of logical and statistical methods for acquiring and using ontologies for computational semantics, and many more. While the workshop will be co-located with PROPOR2016 and papers focusing on Portuguese are of course of interest, we encourage submissions that focus on any language for which lexical resources have traditionally been scarce.



LexSem+Logics 2016 is endorsed by SIGLEX – ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon.





Call for Papers:



The organizers invite submissions of up to 8 pages (+2 for references) on a range of topics, including (but not limited to):



--- recognition, classification and disambiguation of lexical semantic units

--- extracting knowledge using lexical semantic units

--- ontologies, datasets and representations of knowledge

--- logic for semantics of lexical semantic units, sentences, discourse and dialog

--- formal tools in ontology creation, re-use and evaluation

--- formal tools in textual inference, such as logics for natural language inference

--- formal approaches to unifying data-driven and declarative approaches to semantics

--- (open) linking of ontologies, resources and datasets



The proceedings will be made available on the workshop's website by the date of the workshop itself, as well as on a yet-to-decided online open-access publication repository. Hard copies will also be provided to attendees.

SwissText is an annual conference established in 2016 by the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW)  that brings together text analytics experts from industry and academia.



KONVENS has been held regularly since 1992 and deals with all areas of natural language processing.



The joint SwissText + KONVENS 2020 conference will last for three days and will feature the following tracks:



- Applied Track, with a strong focus on industry and applied research. This track constitutes the continuation of the “Swiss Track” from previous SwissText editions.

- Scientific Track, with technical research papers from the international scientific community.

- Demo Track, which provides a platform for companies and universities to showcase their interactive NLP solutions.



Conference website: https://swisstext-and-konvens-2020.org/



Applied Track

-------------



The goal of the Applied Track is to bring together experts from industry and academia. For this track, we are looking for presentations with a strong focus on practical applicability. 



Presentations can be:



- Showcases

- Applications (If you have a live demonstration, please submit to the Demo Track instead)

- Resources

- Applied research results

- Any other contribution that is interesting to the audience



For this track, a short abstract (up to 1500 characters) has to be submitted, along with a CV of the presenter (text format, no tables — max. 500 characters) and the intended audience (e.g. developers, decision makers, project managers, max. 300 characters). All data is entered online via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=swisstextkonvens2020



Note: If you intend to publish a full scientific paper, please submit it to the Scientific Track.



Scientific Track

----------------



In this track, we welcome technical papers dealing with natural language processing, computational linguistics, and machine learning/data science with a focus on text analytics.



The 2020 special theme is: Multilingual NLP



While previous KONVENS editions have traditionally focused on NLP for German, given the multilingual setting of Switzerland (German, French, Italian, Romansh, Swiss German), we encourage NLP researchers working on these languages (plus English as supplement) in and outside of Switzerland to submit their work.



We welcome the following two types of contributions:



- Long papers (8 pages plus references): substantial results

- Short papers (4 pages plus references): progress reports and similar



Submission format:



- Please use the ACL LaTeX template: http://www.acl2019.org/medias/340-acl2019-latex.zip

- Language: English

- Anonymization: The review process will be double blind; we ask authors to anonymize their submission reasonably. Instead of e.g. “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” write “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) …”

- Manuscripts must describe original work that has neither been published before nor is currently under review elsewhere.

- Submission will be made through EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=swisstextkonvens2020



Demo Track

----------



The conference features a dedicated track for demonstrations of available NLP solutions (open source or proprietary). The goal is to give developers, companies, and researchers a platform to showcase their products and tools, and for the audience to get an overview of production-ready NLP solutions. All accepted demos will be presented live during the demo exhibition at the conference.



Please provide a short abstract of your demo (up to 1500 characters), a screenshot of your solution, and a description of the intended audience (e.g. developers, researchers, etc., max. 300 chars). All data is entered online via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=swisstextkonvens2020



Proceedings
