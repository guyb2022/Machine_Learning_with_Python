Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence are two technologies which, when merged, can help each other unleash their true potential. Blockchains can secure the availability and seamless access to integrity-protected large data sets, from various domains, thus facilitating the effective and more profound learning of AI algorithms. Similarly, AI can be utilized to introduce new consensus mechanisms, and therefore, new ways of interacting with Blockchains. However, when it comes to processing sensitive data, like corporate, healthcare and finance data, several security and privacy concerns arise that should be carefully considered. The interaction with Blockchains is subject to data credibility checks, data leakages related to transaction linkability, compliance with data protection regulations, on-chain data privacy, and malicious smart contracts. To address these challenges, new security and privacy-preserving solutions that are either based on AI or utilized for protecting AI-based blockchain data processing are emerging to facilitate the integration of these two cutting-edge technologies.



The aim of the current Research Topic is to cover promising, recent, and novel research trends in the fields of Blockchains and AI with an emphasis on security and privacy. More precisely, the goal is to attract new approaches, innovative machine learning and, generally, intelligent techniques that interact with blockchain technology to create advanced solutions that provide a secure environment for data processing and protect the privacy of individuals. Furthermore, the Research Topic is not limited only on these topics, but also covers issues related with secure decentralized and distributed machine learning, security- and privacy-by-design AI/Blockchain, privacy-preserving blockchain-based solutions, GDPR-compliant AI/Blockchain, and evaluation and optimization of AI/Blockchain solutions.



Areas to be covered in this Research Topic may include, but are not limited to:



    - Privacy-preserving AI/Blockchain solutions

    - Blockchain-based big data sharing for AI

    - Privacy-preserving federated learning

    - Blockchain-based AI

    - Secure decentralized machine learning

    - Secure distributed machine learning

    - On-chain privacy

    - Crypto-privacy AI techniques

    - Smart contract privacy protection using AI

_________________________



SCOPE AND BACKGROUND



DeSForM | Boundless is dedicated to presenting the latest research in the fields of design and technology.



DeSForM (Design and Semantics of Form and Movement) seeks to present current research into the nature, character and behaviour of emerging typologies of connected and intelligent objects within adaptive systems.



The role of design as a vital bridge between human interaction and technological innovation is increasingly evident as the world adapts to the new normal.  Formerly distinct boundaries between disciplines have been blurred as creatives and engineers embark on collective cutting edge endeavors.  DeSForM 2022- Boundless: Aesthetics, Human Experience and Intelligence for the New Normal - the 12th edition of the conference will present leading research that investigates the integration of aesthetics, functionality and advance technologies to enhance experiences, well-being, and business.



The conference will explore how the pursuit of enhanced human experiences connect emergent disruptive technologies with artifacts, intangible services, intelligent systems and traditional skills; effectively creating a boundless space that brings together our spiritual, emotional, and physical selves with the external world.



We will like to invite papers on the following topics:



•	Form, interactivity and the human experience

•	Fashion: Process, Visualizations, Artifacts and Beyond

•	Innovation in product and service design

•	Wearables and alternative skins

Online, Czechia, October 25-27, 2021

Conference website:	https://www.gamesec-conf.org/

Submission link	https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gamesec21

Submission deadline: August 2, 2021

Topics: game theory, adversarial machine learning, decision theory, behavioral models



Modern societies are becoming dependent on information, automation, and communication technologies more than ever. Managing the security of the emerging systems, many of them safety critical, poses significant challenges. The 12th Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security will take place from October 25-27, 2021 as an online event, jointly organized by the Czech Technical University in Prague and Carnegie Mellon University. It focuses on protection of heterogeneous, large-scale and dynamic cyber-physical systems as well as managing security risks faced by critical infrastructures through rigorous and practically relevant analytical methods. GameSec 2021 invites novel, high-quality theoretical and practically relevant contributions, which apply decision and game theory to security problems. The goal of the conference is to bring together academic, government, and industrial researchers in an effort to identify and discuss the major challenges and recent results that highlight the connections between game theory, control, distributed optimization, machine learning, economic incentives, real-world security, reputation, trust and privacy problems. This year, GameSec 2021 provides a special track.





* Special Track on â€œBehavioral Decision and Game Theoryâ€ *

Game theory traditionally presumes a utility maximization paradigm in the prediction of behavior, yet empirical research shows that humans follow more complex patterns of behavior. Comprehensive security needs to address the human factor, since security highly depends on human-machine teaming and human understanding, adherence and trust on security mechanisms. This track invites research that addresses behavioral aspects of decision and game theory relevant to security models, including models of human behavior, and experimental approaches to security.



* Submission Guidelines *

Each submission should be previously unpublished work that is not currently under submission to another conference. Submissions can be (but do not have to be) anonymized. Full paper submissions are not to exceed 20 pages including references and well-formatted appendices. Full papers should make a strong technical contribution and adequately highlight the novel aspects of the work in relation to related research. Short paper submissions may present work in progress, novel applications and practice/industry experiences. Potential short papers will be evaluated based on their novelty and potential for sparking discussions and future collaborations. Short paper submissions are limited to 12 pages. Submission of both regular and short papers should be done by updating the files on EasyChair.



* Submission instructions *

Prospective authors are encouraged to register their paper by uploading title, authors, and a short abstract (a few hundred words, not an extended abstract) by the abstract submission deadline, 23:59 PST time. Then, authors can update the title, authors, abstract and submit a PDF file with the full paper by the full paper submission deadline, 23:59 PST time. Submitting an abstract is not mandatory. Authors can still submit a full paper by the final deadline without having previously submitted an abstract.



For submissions to the special track, please add the line [Submission to the special track â€œBehavioral Decision and Game Theory.â€] as the first words in the paper's abstract, and submit it like a regular paper (this annotation will be automatically removed for the camera ready version by the editors).



Submission Link: https://easychair.org/my/login_author?conference=259617



* Paper Preparation *

All submissions must adhere to the Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format. For a detailed description, please consult the Author Guidelines for the Preparation of Contributions to Springer Computer Science Proceedings (version of 26-FEB-2015 in PDF). The LaTex2e template which supports hyperlinks for the online versions can be downloaded (in zip format). As a sample, the source files of the Author Instructions are also made available by Springer. Although discouraged to use, template files for Office 2007 Word and Office 2003 Word are also provided.



The authors are advised to carefully read the explanatory typing instruction documents contained within the corresponding archive file. Please note that the wide empty margins are to be expected. The LNCS series will be published in a smaller than A4 cut, and hence the margins will be rectified by the publisher.



Authors should consult Springerâ€™s authorsâ€™ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.

The purpose of this special issue is to promote collaboration and cross-fertilisation of ideas between researchers working in different areas of multi-objective decision making and on the topics of interest below, and to provide a forum for dissemination of high-quality multi-objective decision making research.



The special issue targets high-quality original papers covering all aspects of multi-objective decision making, including, but not limited to, the list of topics below. Manuscripts that extend a previous conference or workshop publication are welcome, provided that there is a significant amount of new material in the submission (i.e. the manuscript should contain at least 50% new material).

Before submitting, authors should read the JAAMAS submission guidelines at http://www.springer.com/10458 in full. To submit, you should visit the online system at https://www.editorialmanager.com/agnt/ and create a new account if you do not already have one. When creating your submission on the system, select the submission type ""Manuscript"", and then in the ""Additional Information"" section, answer ""Yes"" when asked if your manuscript belongs to a special issue, then select ""S.I. : Multi-Objective Decision Making (MODeM)"". If you do not mark your manuscript correctly as belonging to the MODeM special issue, it may not reach the correct editors.



MODeM 2021 workshop

In support of this special issue, an online workshop on multi-objective decision making (MODeM 2021) will be held during July 2021 (details TBC). Authors considering submitting to the special issue may also consider submitting a preliminary version of their work to the MODeM 2021 workshop to facilitate opportunities for collaboration and cross-fertilisation of ideas between researchers working in different fields. Submission of preliminary work to the MODeM 2021 workshop does not confer an automatic entitlement to publish in the JAAMAS MODeM special issue; all special issue submissions must pass through the same rigorous JAAMAS review process and meet the standard JAAMAS publication criteria. The JAAMAS MODeM special issue has an open call for papers; it is not necessary to submit preliminary work to the MODeM 2021 workshop in order to have your manuscript considered for publication in this SI.

Call For Papers

==================



KDD OARS is a full day workshop taking place on Aug 14-18th, 2021 in conjunction with KDD 2021 in Singapore.



Workshop website:  https://oars-workshop.github.io/



Important Dates:

==================

- Submissions Due -  May 19th, 2021  

- Notification -  June 10th, 2021    

- Camera Ready Version of Papers Due -  August 1st, 2021

- KDD OARS Full day Workshop -  August 14-18th, 2021



Details:

==================

The KDD workshop on online and adaptative recommender systems (OARS) will serve as a platform for publication and discussion of OARS. This workshop will bring together practitioners and researchers from academia and industry, to discuss the challenges and approaches to implement OARS algorithms and systems and improve user experience by better modeling and responding to user intent.  



Many recommender systems deployed in the real world rely on categorical user-profiles and/or pre-calculated recommendation actions that stay static during a user session. Recent trends suggest that recommender systems should model user intent in real time and constantly adapt to meet user needs at the moment or change user behavior in situ. In addition, various techniques have been proposed to help recommender systems adapt to new users, items, or behaviors. Some strategies to build “adaptive” recommenders include:

Systems for online training, e.g. updating the parameters of a pre-trained model to a new user.

Feature-based systems that handle cold-start scenarios, and can gracefully adapt to a combination of cold- and warm users/items.

Systems that avoid modeling users at all (e.g. session-based recommenders that directly learn from item interactions without needing user terms)

Systems that adapt to new behaviors through RL or other adaptive learning algorithms.



We invite submission of papers and posters of two to ten pages (including references), representing original research, preliminary research results, proposals for new work, and position and opinion papers. All submitted papers and posters will be single-blind and will be peer reviewed by an international program committee of researchers of high repute.  Accepted submissions will be presented at the workshop.



Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

====================================

Novel algorithms and paradigms

- online and adaptive neural recommender

- reinforcement learning (on-policy, off-policy, offline RL, and other relevant subfields)

- online/streaming learning

- interactive and conversational recommender

- extreme classification

- graph recommender



Applications

- product recommendation

- content recommendation

- ads recommendation

- fashion and decor recommendation

- job recommendation

- intervention/behavior change/healthy life-style recommendation



User modeling and representations

- implicit and explicit user intent modeling

- dynamic user intent modeling

- visual/style/taste modeling

- combination of in-session intent with long term user interest

- incorporation of knowledge graph

- representation learning



Architecture and Infrastructure

- scalability of neural methods for large scale real-time recommendations

- steaming and event-driven processing infrastructures



Evaluation and explanation methodologies

- evaluation, comparison, explanation of OARS for a recommendation task

- off-policy and counterfactual evaluation



Social and user impact

- UX for OARS

- welfare and objectives of OARS (CTR, dwell-time, diversity, multi-objectives, long term objectives)

- privacy and ethics considerations



Submission Instructions:

==================

All papers will be peer reviewed (single-blind) by the program committee and judged by their relevance to the workshop, especially to the main themes identified above, and their potential to generate discussion.



All submissions must be formatted according to the ACM template guidelines https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template



Submissions must describe work that is not previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not currently under review elsewhere.  All submissions must be in English.



Please note that at least one of the authors of each accepted paper must register for the workshop and attend the online session to present the paper during the workshop.

Despite the success stories, great challenges still lie ahead of us to make this grand vision come true. On the one hand, future systems have to be yet more capable to perceive, reason, and act in complex real-world scenarios. On the other hand, these future systems have to comply with our expectations for robustness, security, and safety. The ACM Computer Science in Cars Symposium (CSCS) provides a platform for industry and academia to exchange ideas and meet these future challenges jointly. The focus of the 2020 symposium is on Artificial Intelligence & Security for Autonomous Vehicles.



# Artificial Intelligence in Autonomous Systems



Sensing, perception & interaction are key challenges inside and outside the vehicle. Despite the great progress, complex real-world data still poses great challenges towards reliable recognition and analysis in a large range of operating conditions. Latest Machine Learning and in particular Deep Learning techniques have resulted in high-performance approaches that have shown impressive results.



* Robust algorithms for semantic, geometric and dynamic perception around the vehicle

* Driver and interior monitoring

* Interpretable and explainable Deep Neural Networks

* Datasets and benchmarks with real and/or synthetic data as well as novel evaluation strategies

* Fusion of cameras with active sensors, such as LiDAR, Radar, etc.

* Embedded optimization of Deep Neural Networks as well as run-time optimizations



# Automotive Security for Autonomous driving



Information technology enables connected autonomous vehicles and many new applications but also introduces new threats. For example, an attacker could manipulate safety-critical systems such as the braking system to endanger the live and limb of passengers and other road users. An attacker could also try to generate movement or behavior profiles of the vehicle user. Thus, ensuring security and privacy is of paramount importance but poses several challenges. CSCS is a forum for discussing the latest developments in the context of security and privacy for autonomous vehicles and bringing together researchers and practitioners.



* Secure in-vehicle communication and lightweight cryptographic protocols

* System security of electronic control units, gateways etc. (e.g., hardware security, OS security)

* Secure external communication (e.g., V2X, Internet) and protocols (e.g., secure remote update)

* Automotive security standardization, secure software development, security testing

* Automotive Security Monitoring (e.g., IDS, IPS, SIEM, SOC)

* Privacy-enhancing technologies and mechanisms for automotive applications

* Piracy, product counterfeit, and theft protection (e.g., RKE, Immobilizer)

* Safety and Security"

With the steady increase in the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies in various domains, such as Cybersecurity, Helthcare and Transportation, there is a need to make AI and ML algorithms more accessible and easier to develop.



AI and ML algorithms require experts to invest in time to develop models that people can use in their respective domains. Black-box algorithm development allows people to use such models, but these cannot be interpreted, whereas White-box algorithms are interpretable to a certain extent.



This SI focuses on both theoretical and practical aspects of White-box Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Particularly, we are looking for approaches that can facilitate algorithm development to make it less time consuming for developers and enchance the transparency.



Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:



Enchancing usability between AI or ML systems and humans;

Explainability of AI or ML algorithms;

Transparent AI or ML algorithms;

Evaluation metrics;

Visualization techniques;

User interfaces that facilitate algorithm development (GUIs, NLP, Chatbots);

Automated code generation;

Novel applications of Human-Centred AI or ML;

Trust, Privacy and Security Issues;

Experiences with the development of industrial ML systems;

Evaluation of programming languages and libraries when developing ML systems.

1624305942-84,http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=artificial%20intelligence&page=17,FL-ICML 2021,http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=130037&copyownerid=80806,"Call for Papers

Training machine learning models in a centralized fashion often faces significant challenges due to regulatory and privacy concerns in real-world use cases. These include distributed training data, computational resources to create and maintain a central data repository, and regulatory guidelines (GDPR, HIPAA) that restrict sharing sensitive data. Federated learning (FL) is a new paradigm in machine learning that can mitigate these challenges by training a global model using distributed data, without the need for data sharing. The extensive application of machine learning to analyze and draw insight from real-world, distributed, and sensitive data necessitates familiarization with and adoption of this relevant and timely topic among the scientific community.



Despite the advantages of FL, and its successful application in certain industry-based cases, this field is still in its infancy due to new challenges that are imposed by limited visibility of the training data, potential lack of trust among participants training a single model, potential privacy inferences, and in some cases, limited or unreliable connectivity.



The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in FL. This day-long event will facilitate interaction among students, scholars, and industry professionals from around the world to understand the topic, identify technical challenges, and discuss potential solutions. This will lead to an overall advancement of FL and its impact in the community, while noting that FL has become an increasingly popular topic in the ICML community in recent years.



Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Adversarial attacks on FL

- Applications of FL

- Blockchain for FL

- Beyond first-order methods in FL

- Beyond local methods in FL

- Communication compression in FL

- Data heterogeneity in FL

- Decentralized FL

- Device heterogeneity in FL

- Fairness in FL

- Hardware for on-device FL

- Variants of FL like split learning

- Local methods in FL

- Nonconvex FL

- Operational challenges in FL

- Optimization advances in FL

- Partial participation in FL

- Personalization in FL

- Privacy concerns in FL

- Privacy-preserving methods for FL

- Resource-efficient FL

- Systems and infrastructure for FL

- Theoretical contributions to FL

- Uncertainty in FL

- Vertical FL



The workshop will have invited talks on a diverse set of topics related to FL. In addition, we plan to have an industrial panel (over Zoom) and booth (on GatherTown), where researchers from industry will talk about challenges and solutions from an industrial perspective.



More information on previous workshops can be found at http://www.federated-learning.org/.





Proceedings and Dual Submission Policy

Our workshop has no formal proceedings. Accepted papers will be posted on the workshop webpage. We welcome submissions of unpublished papers, including those that are submitted/accepted to other venues if that other venue allows so. We will not accept papers that are already published though, because the goal of the workshop is to share recent results and discuss open problems.





Submission Instructions

Submissions are recommended (but not mandatory) to be no more than 6 pages long, excluding references, and follow ICML-21 template (https://icml.cc/Conferences/2021/StyleAuthorInstructions).

(http://muc2021.mensch-und-computer.de/)





The proliferation of AI-based techniques poses a range of new challenges for the design and engineering of intelligent and adaptive systems since they tend to act as black boxes and do not offer the user sufficient transparency, control, and interaction opportunities, which are considered major goals of user-centered design in the HCI field. The 2nd Workshop on User-Centered Artificial Intelligence (UCAI ‘21), held in conjunction with the 2021 Mensch und Computer conference, aims at sharing and discussing recent developments at the intersection of HCI and AI, and at exploring novel methodological, technical, and interaction approaches. The full-day workshop will feature oral or poster presentations of accepted full and position papers, respectively, and is intended to encourage discussion, networking and advancing the research agenda in this emerging field of research.

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and signal processing are driving the growth of the artificial intelligence market as improved appropriate technologies is critical to offer enhanced drones, self-driving cars, robotics, etc. The two major factors enabling market growth are: emerging artificial intelligence technologies, and growth in intelligent signal processing. Today, more and more sensor manufacturers are using machine learning to sensors and signal data for analyses. It is becoming easier than ever: hardware is becoming smaller and sensors are getting cheaper, making Internet of things devices widely available for a variety of applications ranging from predictive maintenance to user behavior monitoring. However, the increased number of sensors in devices will inherently generate higher data throughput, which poses a serious challenge in managing and processing the tremendous amount of sensory information. Furthermore, traditional processing techniques in conventional sensing devices are no longer suitable for systematically labeling, processing, and analyzing the exuberant amount of information.The global artificial intelligence market size was valued at USD 62.4 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42.2% from 2020 to 2027 to rich 733.7 billion.



The global AI market growth is driven by increasing adoption of cloud-based applications and services growing big data increasing demand for intelligent virtual assistants advances in signal processing. The major restraint for such market is the limited number of AI technology experts. Today, there are approximately 300,000 AI researchers and practitioners worldwide, but the market demand is around millions of roles.



The series of ASPAI conferences have been launched to fill-in this gap and provide a forum for open discussion and development of emerging artificial intelligence and appropriate signal processing technologies focused on real-word implementations by offering Hardware, Software, Services, Technology (Machine Learning, Deep Learing Natural Language Processing, Context-Aware Computing, Computer Vision and Signal Processing). The goal of the conference is to provide an interactive environment for establishing collaboration, exchanging ideas, and facilitating discussion between researchers, manufacturers and users. The 1st ASPAI conference has taken place in Barcelona (Spain) in 2019, and the 2nd one - in Berlin (Germany) in 2020 (in online format).



The ASPAI' 2021 is organized by IFSA with the media partners IOS Press (journal Integrated Computer-Aided Engineering (ISSN: 1069-2509, e-ISSN: 1875-8835)) and World Scientific (International Journal of Neural Systems(ISSN: 0129-0657, e-ISSN: 1793-6462)).



The purpose of ASPAI' 2021 is bring together leading international researchers, developers and practitioners interested in artificial intelligence and appropriate signal processing technologies.



The conference will offer plenary and invited talks, contributed oral and poster presentations. Social and cultural events will also take place to foster networking among the participants in a friendly manner.​ We trust that you will find the ASPAI' 2021 conference professionally rewarding and stimulating as well as enjoyable.

DESCRIPTION:

Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise to improve our healthcare systems. Current AI-based systems already support drug development, triage, screening, diagnosis, and patient follow-up; and the potential is to completely reconfigure the way our healthcare systems work. In the face of such strong potential, many scientists have devoted their research to the development of AI-based systems, and PubMed has seen a tenfold increase in the number of publications mentioning AI, in the past two years alone. Nevertheless, and despite the strong optimism, few AI-based systems have been integrated in everyday care. 



Going the “last mile” with AI-based systems will require not only robust algorithms, but also dealing with implementation challenges and guaranteeing that AI-based system fit the needs and practices of patients, carers, clinicians, and clinical researchers. In other words, we need Human-Computer Interaction and a Human-Centred perspective to help unleash the AI potential in healthcare. 



The HCI community has often been seen as contributing at the margins of the creation of AI-based systems for healthcare. As the majority of research studies focused on demonstrating technical feasibility and performance of algorithms, they could draw on retrospective datasets and refrain from involving users. However, as AI-based systems start to integrate healthcare systems, there is a pressing need for exploring questions related to: i) What constitutes Human-Centred AI in healthcare? ii) How to design AI-based interactive systems for healthcare? and iii) How to deploy and evaluate AI-based systems in practice and what are the sociotechnical and ethical implications for the human end-users? 



Guiding the next generation of HCI work on AI for healthcare are the contributions of the community to Explainable AI, as well as the studies on accountability, transparency, fairness, and ethics. The few ethnographic studies describing AI-based systems use in practice will also be useful in illuminating the assessment of these type of solutions in context. Still, important work is yet to come as designing Human-AI interactions is extremely complex due to the variety of workflows triggered by different datasets, the current lack of iterative prototyping tools, and the difficulties of communicating AI capabilities to the design team. 





TOPICS OF INTEREST:

* Ethnographies that unpack the use, appropriation, and other sociotechnical aspects of AI-based systems in healthcare, in self-care, clinical care, or clinical research; 

* Expectations, perspectives, and misalignments between users and developers; 

* Theoretical discussions of key concepts appearing in the Human-Centred AI literature for healthcare, including explainable AI, accountable AI, as well as fairness or ethics in AI; 

* Theoretical discussions (re-)visiting key HCI concepts in the space, including patient-clinician interaction, shared decision-making, or self-care; 

* Applications and designs that explore and advance Human-Centred AI in healthcare; 

* Methodologies, methods, approaches, or adaptations needed for creating appropriate human-AI interactive systems; 

* Reviews of existing research on the design, integration, and/or evaluation of ML and AI technology in healthcare. 





IMPORTANT DATES:

* Full paper submission deadline: October 29th, 2021 

* First-round reviews to authors: November 30th, 2021 

* 2nd round submission deadline: January 28th, 2022

★About SAGC

Space-air-ground computing, as an integration of satellite systems, aerial networks, terrestrial communications, and Cloud computing has been becoming an emerging computing architecture and attracted intensive research interest.

With the global connectivity services/applications needs to be accommodated, such as ubiquitous communication, smart transportation, smart city, maritime surveillance, and disaster rescue, the terrestrial networks and computing alone cannot meet the needs in an effective and efficient manner. Space-air-ground computing, as an integration of satellite systems, aerial networks, terrestrial communications, and Cloud computing has been becoming an emerging computing architecture and attracted intensive research interest.

Hence, the IEEE International Conference on Space-Air-Ground Computing aims to become a prime international forum for both researchers and industry practitioners to exchange the latest fundamental advances in state of the art and practice of space-air-ground computing in the field of Computer Science and Electronic Engineers.

The workshop will aim to address opportunities where machine learning can bring benefits to networking in different facets, such as network monitoring, management, and security. Together with flexible and programmable networks this paves the way towards a more proactive and autonomous network design and “self-driving” networks. The long-term vision is that configuration decisions can be made in real-time in an automated fashion before service and experience degradation occurs. The workshop will combine original paper presentations with a motivating keynote to thoroughly explore this challenging topic.

Medical imaging is becoming an essential component in various fields of biomedical research and clinical practice: Neuroscientists detect regional metabolic brain activity from positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic resonance spectrum imaging (MRSI) scans. Biologists study cells and generate 3D confocal microscopy data sets. Virologists generate 3D reconstructions of viruses from micrographs. Radiologists identify and quantify tumors from MRI and computed tomography (CT) scans.



On the other hand, image processing includes the analysis, enhancement, and display of biomedical images. Image reconstruction and modeling techniques allow instant processing of 2D signals to create 3D images. Image processing and analysis can be used to determine the diameter, volume, and vasculature of a tumor or organ, flow parameters of blood or other fluids, and microscopic changes that have yet to raise any otherwise discernible flags. Image classification techniques help to detect subjects suffering from particular diseases and to detect disease-related regions.



This Special Issue aims to provide a diverse, but complementary, set of contributions to demonstrate new developments and applications in the field of medical imaging and image processing.

Healthcare systems are overburdened by lack of personnel, budget constraints, emergency, exceptional events, and age-related chronic diseases. The innovation of health services, infrastructures, and processes are compelling, as even more manifested by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. From this perspective, AI methods and techniques are required (and expected) to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and the quality of healthcare systems and their processes. Existing challenges are both in terms of healthcare and also economic.



Cognitive agents (e.g. digital assistants, cognitive twins, chatbots etc.), autonomous agents and humanoid robots are among the most impacting research fields in artificial intelligence, which have proven to be essential for the digitalization of healthcare. For example, robots are increasingly required to play an active role in helping the patients and the medical doctors in the execution of rehabilitation and the explanation of therapy protocols. Similarly, cognitive agents are asked to assist the patients in doing cognitive exercises, checking their health-related pathology status and eventually alerting the doctors when some problematic issues should eventually emerge by providing a preliminary diagnosis of the patient status. Specific topics such as aging, active living, chronic diseases, or others related to the quality of life play an increasingly important role in this research field.



This Research Topic calls for research discussing techniques, problems, challenges, and applications of cognitive agents and robotics in healthcare scenarios.



Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):



• Clinical agent-based decision- support systems, including recommender systems

• Conversational agents and personal digital assistants for patient empowerment

• Human-robot interaction in healthcare

• Artificial Companions for elderly people

• Humanoid Robots and Cognitive Assistants for COVID-19

• Autonomous and remote care delivery

• Responsible and ethical AI in healthcare: agents models and architectures

• Responsible and ethical AI in healthcare: agent-based simulations and applications

• Cognitive agents and robots for interpretability and explainability

• Trust, security, and privacy in human-centered healthcare intelligent systems

• Autonomous health monitoring and assistance

• Robotic, autonomous systems for healthcare

• Intelligent detection of health issues

• Architectures for healthcare systems



Keywords: cognitive agents, autonomous systems, healthcare, humanoids, human-robot interaction



Important Note: All contributions to this Research Topic must be within the scope of the section and journal to which they are submitted, as defined in their mission statements. Frontiers reserves the right to guide an out-of-scope manuscript to a more suitable section or journal at any stage of peer review.

According to the US-Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), “most successful attacks result from targeting and exploiting known, non-patched software vulnerabilities and insecure software configurations, many of which are introduced during design and code.” Hence, it is imperative that secure design, coding and testing principles as well as deployment and maintenance are thoroughly embedded in the software development lifecycle. At the same time, software security is very inter-disciplinary, as software is being developed for a variety of applications – web, Internet, database, single and distributed computer systems, etc.

In the above context, the Fifth International Conference on Software Security brings together researchers, faculty, students and industry professionals who are experts in different domains of computer and information security, but all leading to the design, development, deployment and maintenance of secure software. We invite papers that are both theoretical as well as practical in nature, from both academia and industry. Some of the topics of interest (but not limited to) are:Topics of Interest Software Security Attacks and Solutions

The importance of ""stories"" in Case-Based Reasoning research goes back to the seminal work of Roger Schank on episodic memories. In this workshop we intend to explore a very broad interpretation of reasoning with stories that may include: narratives, traces of user behaviors while interacting with a (gaming or non-gaming) system, presentations, and other environment interactions that can be represented as an event sequence.



This workshop is intended to encompass a broad interest from within the CBR community and also outside (e.g. AI/games, Textual CBR, ITS, recommender systems, computational creativity and storytelling systems). The workshop's aim is to get a people from a broad set of backgrounds interested in thinking about their work from the perspective of story interpretation and reasoning, with the potential of allowing attendants to leverage work that they previously thought was more distantly-related to their own.



Finally, the workshop intends to discuss the relation of episodes (and episodic memory) with stories and cases. Stories can be seen as a narrative description of an episode, or the creative combination of several episodes, while textual CBR can be seen as understanding a textual description of an episode as a case. Thus the relationship between stories, episodes, and cases can be of particular interest for discussion.



AIMS AND OBJECTIVES  



The aim of this workshop is to provide a forum for the discussion concerning the conceptual foundation, the research issues and the practical experiences relation to stories and cases, including the roles of episodic memory and analogy in both of them.



To achieve this purpose the workshop will include the following activities:



presentation of peer-reviewed (application/research) papers;

presentation of position papers;

a panel discussion on stories, episodes and cases; and

an invited talk

We particularly welcome for this workshop contributions in areas that include, but are not limited to, the following:



* On the relation of stories vs. episodic memory vs. cases

* Explaining or interpreting sequential episodes and cases

* The role of analogy in stories and cases

* CBR and cases in story generation

* Narrating sequential episodes and cases

* Cases and stories in computer games

* Computational creativity and analogy in stories



CONTRIBUTIONS SUBMISSION AND FORMAT  



Papers, with a maximum of 10 pages, must be submitted in electronic form as PDF via the EasyChair ICCBR 2012 Site. Springer LNCS is the format required for the final camera-ready copy, Authors' instructions along with LaTeX and Word macro files are available on the web at Springer.

The omnipresence of such intelligent machines poses certain ethical and legal challenges. To ensure the beneficence of autonomous agents towards humans (and other machines), we need to introduce ethical and legal mechanism(s) to govern and align actions executed by AI-based algorithms according to our societal ethical and moral norms. The challenge of encoding our ethical preferences into machines is two-fold: Technical and Philosophical. Regarding the former, various frameworks have been already proposed to realize operationalizable ethics. These frameworks can be roughly divided into three categories: 1) Probabilistic approaches 2) Learning-Based approaches 3) Logic-Based approaches. Regarding the latter, there are also ethical challenges to consider. Some dispute that machines cannot act ethically at all, since this presupposes the possibility of reflection and justification. Regardless of this objection, there is by no means agreement among ethicists about which ethical principles should be implemented and in which hierarchical relationship they should stand to each other. In light of the fact that the systems that might even get into the situation of having to make an ethically relevant decision on their own have yet to be developed, the debate on implementing ethical principles in AI systems is still in its infancy.

The IEEE Third International Conference On Artificial Intelligence

Testing (AITest 2021) is an international conference to provide a

platform for researchers, practitioners, and students to present

research results and exchanges ideas on how to test applications

empowered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and how to empower software

testing methodology and techniques with AI. AI technologies are widely

used in computer applications to perform tasks such as monitoring,

forecasting, recommending, prediction, and statistical reporting. They

are deployed in a variety of systems including driverless vehicles,

robot-controlled warehouses, financial forecasting applications, and

security enforcement, and are increasingly integrated with

cloud/fog/edge computing, big data analytics, robotics,

Internet-of-Things, mobile computing, smart cities, smart homes,

intelligent healthcare, etc. Despite this dramatic progress, the

quality assurance of existing AI application development processes is

still far from satisfactory and the demand for being able to show

demonstrable levels of confidence in such systems is growing. Software

testing is a fundamental, effective, and recognized quality assurance

method which has shown its cost-effectiveness to ensure the

reliability of many complex software systems. However, the adaptation

of software testing to the peculiarities of AI applications remains

largely unexplored and needs extensive research to be performed. On

the other hand, the availability of AI technologies provides an

exciting opportunity to improve existing software testing processes,

and recent years have shown that machine learning, data mining,

knowledge representation, constraint optimization, planning,

scheduling, multi-agent systems, etc. have real potential to

positively impact on software testing. Recent years have seen a rapid

growth of interest in testing AI applications as well as the

application of AI techniques to software testing. This conference

provides an international forum for researchers and practitioners to

exchange novel research results, to articulate the problems and

challenges from practices, to deepen our understanding of the subject

area with new theories, methodologies, techniques, processes models,

etc., and to improve the practices with new tools and resources.

Scope:

Considered a subfield of computational intelligence focused on combinatorial optimisation problems, evolutionary computation is associated with systems that use computational models of evolutionary processes as the key elements in design and implementation, i.e. computational techniques which are based to some degree on the evolution of biological life in the natural world. A number of evolutionary computational models have been proposed, including evolutionary algorithms, genetic algorithms, the evolution strategy, evolutionary programming and swarm intelligence. These techniques form the basis of several disciplines such as artificial life and evolutionary robotics. This conference intends to be a major forum for scientists, engineers and practitioners interested in the study, analysis, design, modeling and implementation of evolvable systems, both theoretically and in a broad range of application fields. ECTA welcomes both theoretical research and practical applications. The conference also aims to foster hybrid approaches within evolutionary computation and also involving fuzzy computation and neural computation.

These wearable and smart mobile devices are widely being utilized to capture many health and fitness parameters for monitoring normal people, patients, and higher quality of life (QoL) for ageing citizens. The business ecosystem based on consumer oriented wearable self-tracking devices, smartphone apps and related services is being developed. Various methods have been devised to collect data as well as analyses using data mining, machine learning, deep learning, statistics, information science, sociology, and psychology. Such techniques provide new opportunities to enrich the understanding of individual and population health. Data from wearable devices provide better measures of everyday behaviour and lifestyle, can complement more traditional clinical data collection, and pandemic analyses for a finer and comprehensive picture of individual and public health.



HealthWear will bring together researchers, developers, designer and industry professionals from both Healthcare community and University to discuss key issues, opportunities and obstacles for personal and public health data research. These include challenges of capturing, summarizing, presenting and retrieving relevant information from heterogeneous sources to support a new vision of pervasive personal healthcare.

NEW Submission deadline: May 14, 2021



Topics: deception, artificial intelligence



There is no dominant theory of deception. The literature on deception treats different aspects and components of deception separately, sometimes offering contradictory evidence and opinions on these components. Emerging AI techniques offer an exciting and novel opportunity to expand our understanding of deception from a computational perspective. However, the design, modelling and engineering of deceptive machines is not trivial from either conceptual, engineering, scientific, or ethical perspectives.



The aim of DeceptAI is to bring together people from academia, industry and policy-making to discuss and disseminate the current and future threats, risks, benefits and challenges of designing deceptive AI. The workshop proposes a multidisciplinary (Computer Science, Psychology, Sociology, Philosophy & Ethics, Military Studies, Law etc.) approach to discuss the following aspects of deceptive AI:

 • Behaviour       

     o What type of machine behaviour should be considered deceptive?             

     o How do we study deceptive behaviour in machines as opposed to humans? 

 • Reasoning      

     o What kind of reasoning mechanisms lie behind deceptive behaviour?             

     o What type of reasoning mechanisms are more prone to deception?             

 • Cognition         

     o How does cognition affect deception and how does deception affect cognition? 

     o What function, if any, do agent cognitive architectures play in deception?                     

 • AI, Ethics, & Society   

     o How does the ability of machines to deceive influence society?                   

     o What kinds of measures do we need to take in order to neutralise or mitigate the negative effects of deceptive AI?                       

 • Engineering Principles

     o How should we engineer autonomous agents such that we are able to know why and when they deceive?               

     o Why should or shouldn't we engineer or model deceptive machines?



Submission Guidelines

All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. The following paper categories are welcome:

  • Full papers (16 pages +references) describing novel work in the area of Deceptive AI. 

  • Short Papers (8 pages + references) describing novel work in the area of Deceptive AI, this may include Work-in-Progress.

  • Position Papers (2-6 pages) describing research challenges related to Deceptive AI.



Note the formatting has wide margins making the page length much longer than expected. 5 pages is equivalent to 2 pages in IJCAI's formatting.



All papers will be reviewed by at least two members of the Program Committee. Review process will be double-blind, therefore please remove author names and affiliations. All papers should be formatted following the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science LNCS/LNAI style and submitted through the EasyChair link below.

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and signal processing are driving the growth of the artificial intelligence market as improved appropriate technologies is critical to offer enhanced drones, self-driving cars, robotics, etc. The two major factors enabling market growth are: emerging artificial intelligence technologies, and growth in intelligent signal processing. Today, more and more sensor manufacturers are using machine learning to sensors and signal data for analyses. It is becoming easier than ever: hardware is becoming smaller and sensors are getting cheaper, making Internet of things devices widely available for a variety of applications ranging from predictive maintenance to user behavior monitoring. However, the increased number of sensors in devices will inherently generate higher data throughput, which poses a serious challenge in managing and processing the tremendous amount of sensory information. Furthermore, traditional processing techniques in conventional sensing devices are no longer suitable for systematically labeling, processing, and analyzing the exuberant amount of information. The global artificial intelligence market size was valued at USD 62.4 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42.2% from 2020 to 2027 to rich 733.7 billion.



The global AI market growth is driven by increasing adoption of cloud-based applications and services growing big data increasing demand for intelligent virtual assistants advances in signal processing. The major restraint for such market is the limited number of AI technology experts. Today, there are approximately 300,000 AI researchers and practitioners worldwide, but the market demand is around millions of roles.



The series of ASPAI conferences have been launched to fill-in this gap and provide a forum for open discussion and development of emerging artificial intelligence and appropriate signal processing technologies focused on real-word implementations by offering Hardware, Software, Services, Technology (Machine Learning, Deep Learing Natural Language Processing, Context-Aware Computing, Computer Vision and Signal Processing). The goal of the conference is to provide an interactive environment for establishing collaboration, exchanging ideas, and facilitating discussion between researchers, manufacturers and users. The 1st ASPAI conference has taken place in Barcelona (Spain) in 2019, and the 2nd one - in Berlin (Germany) in 2020 (in online format).



The ASPAI' 2021 is organized by IFSA with the media partners IOS Press (journal Integrated Computer-Aided Engineering (ISSN: 1069-2509, e-ISSN: 1875-8835)) and World Scientific (International Journal of Neural Systems(ISSN: 0129-0657, e-ISSN: 1793-6462)).



The purpose of ASPAI' 2021 is bring together leading international researchers, developers and practitioners interested in artificial intelligence and appropriate signal processing technologies.



The conference will offer plenary and invited talks, contributed oral and poster presentations. Social and cultural events will also take place to foster networking among the participants in a friendly manner.​ We trust that you will find the ASPAI' 2021 conference professionally rewarding and stimulating as well as enjoyable.

Workshop URL: http://www.taln.upf.edu/pages/cttsr2021-ws/



Thanks to the availability of texts on the Web in recent years, increased knowledge and information have been made available to broader audiences. However, the way in which a text is written— vocabulary, syntax, text organization/structure —can be difficult to read and understand for many people, especially those with low literacy, cognitive or linguistic impairment, or those with limited knowledge of the language of the text. Texts containing uncommon words or long and complicated sentences can be difficult to read and understand by people as well as difficult to analyse by machines. Automatic text simplification is the process of transforming a text into another text which, ideally conveying the same message, will be easier to read and understand by a broader audience.



Research in text simplification has been approached from different angles: rule-based linguistically informed methods, unsupervised corpus-based techniques, supervised machine learning or statistical machine translation have all been attempted in text simplification. Recently, research in text simplification has, like in many other natural language processing areas, increased the use of methods derived from the deep learning paradigm, and more specifically end-to-end sequence to sequence, and transformer-based learning methods. In spite of the current advances in the field, there are many important aspects of the simplification problem that need the attention of our community, including but not limited to: the design of appropriate evaluation metrics, the development of context-aware simplification solutions, the creation of appropriate language resources to support research and evaluation, the deployment of simplification in real environments for real users, the study of discourse factors in text simplification, the identification of factors affecting the readability of a text, etc.



The workshop aims at bringing together researchers, developers and industries of assistive technologies, public organizations representatives, and other parties interested in the problem of making information more accessible to all citizens.  We will discuss recent trends and developments in the area of automatic text simplification, automatic readability assessment, language resources and evaluation for text simplification, etc.

Scope:

The purpose of the International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence is to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners interested in the theory and applications in the areas of Agents and Artificial Intelligence. Two simultaneous related tracks will be held, covering both applications and current research work. One track focuses on Agents, Multi-Agent Systems and Software Platforms, Distributed Problem Solving and Distributed AI in general. The other track focuses mainly on Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Representation, Planning, Learning, Scheduling, Perception Reactive AI Systems, and Evolutionary Computing and other topics related to Intelligent Systems and Computational Intelligence.  A substantial amount of research work is ongoing in these knowledge areas, in an attempt to discover appropriate theories and paradigms to use in real-world applications. Much of this important work is therefore theoretical in nature. However there is nothing as practical as a good theory, as Boltzman said many years ago, and some theories have indeed made their way into practice. Informatics applications are pervasive in many areas of Artificial Intelligence and Distributed AI, including Agents and Multi-Agent Systems; This conference intends to emphasize this connection, therefore, authors are invited to highlight the benefits of Information Technology (IT) in these areas. Ideas on how to solve problems using agents and artificial intelligence, both in R&D and industrial applications, are welcome. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Papers describing original work are invited in any of the areas listed below. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the Proceedings of ICAART with an ISBN. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. Both full research reports and work-in-progress reports are welcome. There will be both oral and poster sessions.  Special sessions, dedicated to case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as tutorials dedicated to technical/scientific topics are also envisaged: companies interested in presenting their products/methodologies or researchers interested in holding a tutorial are invited to contact the conference secretariat. Additional information can be found at http://www.icaart.org/.

Special Issue Information:

==========================



Dear Colleagues,



The generalization of the use of advanced technological tools in the field of educational is leading to the generation of big data related to academic activities which involve students and teachers. For example, the inclusion of virtual campuses as a regular educational management tool encourages the virtualization of teaching, the online management of grades, the monitoring of student progress, the recording of all kinds of educational variables, etc. In this way, technology-enhanced learning (TEL) platforms allow one to generate and store data that stand out, not only for their huge amount and heterogeneity, but above all, for their link to a time dimension that allows one to analyze and predict student behaviour in its dynamic context, among other purposes.



There are many interesting research lines that deserve to be explored in the education area, such as analyzing and predicting students' behaviour, developing advanced tools for supporting learning stages, recommending activities, predicting dropout, optimizing resources, etc. For these purposes, there are advanced methods from computational science that have demonstrated a high effectiveness when handling data and processes that are strongly interconnected. Data mining, big data, machine learning, deep learning, collaborative filtering, and recommender systems, among other fields related to artificial intelligence, allow for the development of advanced techniques that provide a significant potential for the above purposes, leading to new applications and more effective approaches in academic analysis and prediction.



This Special Issue provides a collection of papers of original advances in the analysis, prediction, and recommendation of applications propelled by artificial intelligence, data science, data analytics, big data, and machine learning, especially in the TEL context. Papers about these topics are welcomed.

In conjunction with the 30th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-2021) https://ijcai-21.org 



The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in people’s everyday life has grown exponentially over the last decade. Currently, individuals rely heavily on intelligent software applications across different domains including healthcare, logistics, defence, and governance. Particularly, AI systems facilitate decision-making processes across these domains through the automatic analysis and classification of large data sets and the subsequent identification of relevant patterns. To a large extent, such an approach has contributed to the sustainable development of modern societies and remains a powerful instrument for social and economic growth. However, recent events related to the massive spread of misinformation and deepfakes, along with large privacy and security breaches, have raised concerns among AI practitioners and researchers about the negative and detrimental impacts of these technologies. Hence, there is an urgent call for guidelines, methods, and techniques to assess and mitigate the potentially adverse impacts and side effects of AI applications.



This workshop explores how and up to which extent AI technologies can serve deceptive and malicious purposes either intentionally or not. Furthermore, it seeks to elaborate on countermeasures and mitigation actions to prevent potential negative effects and collateral damages of AI systems. For this, we invite AI researchers and practitioners across different disciplines and knowledge backgrounds to submit contributions dealing with the following (or related) topics:



Hazardous AI applications:

     - Deepfakes.

     - Fake news and misinformation.

     - Online deception.

     - Malicious personalization.

     - Social engineering.



Adverse impacts of AI:

     - Privacy and security breaches.

     - Backfire effects.

     - Guidelines and mitigation actions.

     - Ethical conflicts and challenges.

     - Risk assessment methods.



Responsible AI:

     - Case studies.

     - Best practices for trustworthy AI.



We welcome submissions spanning the full range of theoretical and applied work including user research, methods, tools, simulations, demos, and practical evaluations. Submissions should be 6-8 pages for full technical papers and 2-4 pages for position papers or demos including references. Papers should be formatted according to the IJCAI instructions. Templates (Word and Latex) and complete guidelines can be found here https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit



Submissions will be peer-reviewed by 2-3 members of the program committee in a single-blind process. Accepted papers will be included in the workshop proceedings and published on CEUR-WS. Selected papers will be invited afterwards to submit an extended version for a special issue in a journal edited by the workshop organizers.

TOPICS OF INTEREST

This year we encourage authors to submit academic work at the intersection of:



AI & Arts

The town where the conference will take place, Esch sur Alzette will be the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2022. For this event the University of Luxembourg will create an AI&Art Pavilion, which aims to reflect on AI and the future of art including AI generated painting, AI painting style transfer, AI & Music, etc. In this emerging and hot topic, we expect papers exploring the relations between AI and Art from various points of view from using AI as a technology for art production to art production questioning the place of AI in our societies.



AI & Law

The application of AI tools in and for the legal domain is a manifold and continuously enriching area with quickly increasing interest from and involvement of both the legal professionals and AI researchers. The theoretical foundations and applications in AI & Law don’t only aim at modeling legal reasoning, providing analysis of trends and making legal tasks easier and more efficient, but also at providing foundations for law-abiding artificial agents. The topics range from rule-based reasoning, case-based reasoning, and formal legal ontologies, through computational legal argumentation, theory construction and legal deontics, until ML for legal analytics and RegTech.



AI & Ethics

The significant impact of AI, machine learning and robotics on society and the development of humanity is unquestionable. Its nature, controllability, tools, dangers and potential constraints have been subject to hot debates notably when AI is used in applications with sensitive ethical consequences (e-health, surveillance, human resources, micro-finance, etc.) since this raises concern about its fairness, accountability, and transparency. Thus, especially with the recent debates about user privacy and the Covid Tracking apps, this topic will remain a hot topic throughout the year of 2021.



AI & Systems

Over the last decade, computing became consistently ubiquitous and pervasive in all aspects of our private and professional lives, ending up in a seamless integration of distributed computing power, software, data, sensors, and actuators interacting with each other and with humans ultimately making the concept of ambient intelligence a reality as Cyber-Physical Social Systems. AI is central in such systems both as the functional computation building blocks and as means to create natural and seamless interactions among humans and between humans and their smart physical environment. From applying AI to IoT systems, paradigms like cognitive computing emerged and have raised the interest of the AI community. In this specific track, contributions on the application of AI on systems ranging from classic IoT to advanced cognitive systems including human in the loop are expected.

The 18th International Conference on Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence 2021 is an annual forum that will bring together ideas, projects, lessons, etc. associated with distributed computing and artificial intelligence, and their application in different areas. This meeting will be held in Salamanca (Spain) within PAAMS'21 in 6th-8th October, 2021.

 

Nowadays, most computing systems from personal laptops/computers to cluster/grid /cloud computing systems are available for parallel and distributed computing. Distributed computing performs an increasingly important role in modern signal/data processing, information fusion and electronics engineering (e.g. electronic commerce, mobile communications and wireless devices). Particularly, applying artificial intelligence in distributed environments is becoming an element of high added value and economic potential. Research on Intelligent Distributed Systems has matured during the last decade and many effective applications are now deployed. The artificial intelligence is changing our society. Its application in distributed environments, such as the Internet, electronic commerce, mobile communications, wireless devices, distributed computing, and so on is increasing and is becoming an element of high added value and economic potential, both industrial and research. These technologies are changing constantly as a result of the large research and technical effort being undertaken in both universities and businesses. The exchange of ideas between scientists and technicians from both academic and business areas is essential to facilitate the development of systems that meet the demands of today's society. The technology transfer in this field is still a challenge and for that reason this type of contributions will be specially considered in this symposium.

Special issue information

-------------------------



Sentiment analysis (SA) is the field of natural language processing that deals with the automatic comprehension of opinions shared by users across different media. The traditional application of SA is to scan the opinions of users written on social networks and websites to find out how people perceive a product or service—which aspects are working and which have to be improved. This has caused a surge of technological solutions for SA, leading to the development of a wide range of systems, from those based on knowledge that makes use of lexical, syntactic and semantic information to those that are based on supervised learning through the creation of large pre-trained models of deep neural networks. These systems allow SA to be applied to areas that go beyond the product perceptions and written text.



Current challenges include analyzing texts in which segments written in one language are mixed with segments written in another language (code switching) or in which some elements are written in a language using morphological and syntactic structures from another language (code mixing); jointly analyzing the information provided by images and video together with the associated text (captions, subtitles, descriptions, etc.), so common in the web nowadays; extending sentiment analysis techniques so that they are not only able to determine people’s emotions but also their behavior, to aid in the prevention of sexism, racism, abuse and harassment on social networks; determining people’s mental health in order to alert serious conditions, such as depression and suicidal tendencies; to give just a few examples. In this Special Issue, we thus focus on approaches defining models and resources to deal with new challenging applications of SA technology in an effective manner.



The topics of interest include but are not limited to:



1) Multilingual sentiment analysis;

2) Sentiment analysis for low-resource languages;

3) Multimedia sentiment analysis from video, image and text;

4) Sentiment analysis for political, social and economic analysis;

5) Sentiment analysis for security monitoring;

6) Sentiment analysis for detecting sexism, racism, bullying and harassment;

7) Sentiment analysis for health;

8) Language resources for emerging applications of SA.

Specific examples of such systems include perceptual user interfaces, intelligent assistants, conversational agents, adaptive systems, and more. Creating successful systems of this kind requires solving numerous interaction design and computational challenges and necessarily requires a multidisciplinary approach. ACM IUI supports this multidisciplinary approach to research and innovation by bringing together researchers and practitioners from the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and many others. 



ACM IUI is particularly known for disseminating research that combines computational innovation, novel interaction design, and empirical evidence that demonstrate the resulting solution is valuable to people. However, ACM IUI also welcomes a broad range of contributions including algorithms, computational modelling approaches, enabling technologies, critical perspectives, behavioral and user studies, novel methodologies, data sets, etc. Contributions are expected to be supported by rigorous evidence appropriate to the claims (e.g., a user study, system evaluation, computational analysis). Contributions are welcome from all relevant arenas—academia, industry, government, and non-profit organizations. The conference is large enough to be diverse and lively, but small enough to allow for extensive interaction among attendees and easy attendance to the events that the conference offers, ranging from oral paper presentations, to poster sessions, interactive demonstrations, workshops, panels, and a doctoral consortium for graduate students.



*****  Topics  *****



IUI topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 



- Human-oriented AI methods and approaches 

e.g., explainable AI methods (e.g., transparency and interpretability), persuasive technologies in IUI, privacy and security of IUI, planning and plan recognition for IUI, knowledge-based approaches to user interface design and generation, user modelling for intelligent interfaces, user-adaptive interaction and personalization, crowd computing and human computation, human-centred design.



- Computational innovation 

e.g., modelling approaches, machine learning methods, human-in-the loop machine learning, and interactive machine learning.



- Interface types and modalities 

e.g., affective and aesthetic interfaces, collaborative interfaces, speech-based interfaces, AR/VR interfaces, intelligent wearable and mobile interfaces, ubiquitous smart environments, embodied agents, virtual assistants, multi-modal interfaces, conversational interfaces, tangible interfaces, intelligent visualization.



- Evaluations of intelligent user interfaces

e.g., user experiments and studies, reproducibility (including benchmarks, datasets, and challenges), meta-analysis, mixed-methods evaluations.



- Application areas of IUI 

e.g., education and learning-related technologies, health and intelligent health technologies, assistive technologies, social media and other Web technologies, mobile applications, intelligent assistants, conversational agents, Information retrieval, search, and recommendation system, internet of things (IoT).

However, Simplexity's motto for human players, ""simple to learn, complex to master"", could also be applied to AI implementations. The added complexity over Connect-4 means that, in Simplexity, a less observant player can lose in its turn. Together with arbitrary game dimensions and a short playing time, the challenges for the AI are multifold. The competition will run on two distinct tracks, each offering a prize money of $500 (USD) to the winner  — sponsored by the IEEE CIS Competition Subcommittee.

On one hand computers are continuing to be humanized and a large number of cyber-physical systems are being developed to act upon the physical world. On the other hand the robotic community is looking into the robots of the 21st century that are versatile computing machines with high social impact potential, such as enhance transportation safety, reduce agricultural pesticide use, and improve public safety and crime-fighting efficacy, among other things. The barriers that restrain their diffusion significantly correlate to the complexity of developing their software control systems, which must be reliable, maintainable, intelligent, and safe.



Robotic Computing (RC) addresses the synergetic interaction of computing technologies and robotic technologies. The synergy between Robotics and Computer Science is both realistic and strategic. Their mutual benefit is to make it possible to build and evolve new robotic systems, to reduce their development cost, and to enhance their quality.

Intelligent Environments (IEs) are becoming an integral part of our everyday lives. IEs are living environments – both indoors and outdoors - fitted with sensors and actuators to interpret our behaviour, intentions and goals to provide intelligent services.



Better functionality and better user experiences depends on the accuracy of sensor-based activity and behaviour recognition from ambient and wearable sensors. This is necessary for many applications, especially those that involve ambient assisted living in smart homes such as health monitoring or behavioural interventions.



In a traditional approach, building a robust and meaningful classifiers often relies on getting the right high-quality, carefully annotated, dataset and the right classifier model to optimize the dataset before applying it on new data.



However, IEs are characterised by a constantly changing environment whether in terms of materials (for example, when devices come and go), the physical environment (in mobile environments), users (for example, new staff or visitors) or task (for example new activities).



Current approaches have made substantial contributions to the field of multi-user, concurrent and unknown activity recognition, but these tasks still remain challenging, especially when a model learned for one environment is applied to another.



Another challenge is the lack of high-quality annotated sensor data which most existing machine learning algorithms use. These are extremely costly to acquire and are specific for each new task and environment with the risk of biasing the classifiers. Hence, traditional off-line machine learning is often not suitable for real-world applications.



Scope



In this special issue we seek novel research contributions on sensor-based HAR Human Activity Recognition) and HBR (Human Behaviour Recognition) which leverage on-line optimisation techniques including reinforcement, lifelong learning, zero-shot learning, federated learning, interactive learning.



Papers looking at recent pure end-to-end deep models are welcome, as are papers that describe other models, such as the hybridisation between symbolic reasoning (common sense, descriptive logic) and statistic/neural reasoning.



Papers should contain original work that looks at intelligent systems that not only fuse on accuracy but also provide deep analysis of the results and provide insight on the task. For this reason, papers that focus on benchmarking HAR and HBR models in real world settings are especially welcome.



Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:



    Wearable computing and wearable sensing

    Machine learning for sensor-based HAR and HBR

    Knowledge acquisition, representation and reasoning for intelligent environments

    Fusion of Expert Knowledge and Machine learning

    Adaptive HAR and HBR to new situations and sensors

    Unsupervised acquisition of HAR and HBR models

    User-in-the-loop acquisition of HAR and HBR models

    Transfer learning, lifelong learning, federated learning and reinforcement learning for HAR and HBR

    Task, Corpus and evaluation methods for bench-marking adaptive HAR and HBR

    Analysis of biases in HAR and HBR models

    Context aware interactive or dialogue systems in intelligent environments

    Crowd-sourcing and participatory sensing for HAR and HBR modelling

    Performance evaluation of sensor-based HAR and HBR models

According to the C2ES, renewables made up more than 20 percent of net U.S. energy consumed globally for heating, power, and transportation. Nearly 60 percent came from modern renewables (i.e., biomass, geothermal, solar, hydro, wind, and biofuels). In the industrial sector, biomass makes up 98 percent of the renewable energy use with nearly 60 percent derived from biomass wood, 32 percent from biofuels, and nearly 7 percent from biomass waste. In the transportation sector, renewable fuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, have increased significantly during the past decade. E85 (ethanol transportation fuel) is expected to be the fastest growing renewable energy type, growing at an average annual rate of 9.7 percent over the next 30 years.

In recent years, the increasing frequency and ferocity of cyberattacks has driven the cybersecurity community to establish advanced and intelligent solutions to share and use cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to enhance our ability to identify malicious activity and its sources, inform decision-making solutions, and mitigate attacks in a timely manner. CTI facilitates situational awareness of the threat landscape, a deeper understanding of threat actors and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and greater agility to defend against evolving threats.



However, the management of accurate, reliable, and complete cyber threat information from deployed security appliances, deception solutions, and third parties is increasingly challenging. The adoption of various methods, standards, and practices introduces major interoperability concerns. Legal requirements that dictate appropriate protection of users’ privacy must be respected and automating the process to improve the community’s readiness in counteracting cyber threats is essential. Investment in artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques is necessary for more efficient analysis of the vast amounts of information produced and exchanged among stakeholders to enhance the ability to reveal unexpected insights from communicated data, cope with the smart and innovative methods used by threat actors, and to identify advanced anti-forensics and evasion methods adopted by cyber-criminals. Considering the above and the increasing reliance of defense mechanisms on CTI sharing, research on advanced solutions for CTI management and sharing is significantly important.



This Special Issue aims to publish work relating to recent advances in CTI, regarding every step of its lifecycle, from its creation and sharing to analysis and consumption, aiming to significantly enhance the value of CTI for the cyber community. We welcome both original research and review articles.



Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:



    - Threat modelling

    - Threat and vulnerability analysis

    - Artificial intelligence/machine learning-based cyber threat analysis

    - Data privacy in CTI management

    - Interoperability issues in CTI sharing

    - CTI evaluation

    - Deception technologies

    - Dynamic risk management analysis

    - Cyber-threat detection and response

    - CTI sharing

    - CTI consumption and integration

    - Cyber-threat hunting and curation

    - Blockchain-based CTI management

    - Dark web CTI exploration

    - Threat analysis for cyber-physical systems

    - CTI-based dynamic risk management



The submission deadline for this Special Issue is 23 July 2021.

AIMLSystems is a brand new conference targeting research in the intersection of AI/ML techniques and systems engineering. Through this conference we plan to bring out and highlight the natural connections between these two fields. Specifically we explore how immense strides in AI/ML techniques are made possible through computational systems research (e.g., improvements in CPU/GPU architectures, data-intensive infrastructure, communications etc.),  how the use of AI/ML can help in the continuous and workload-driven design space exploration of computational systems (e.g., self-tuning databases, learning compiler optimizers, learnable network systems etc.) and, the use of AI/ML in the design of socio-economic systems such as public healthcare, and security.  The goal is to bring together these diverse communities and elicit connections between them.



The conference is planned to be held in hybrid mode allowing both online and in-person participation.



Contributions are invited under Research, Industry & Applications, and Demonstration Tracks of the conference. Authors are encouraged to submit previously unpublished research at the intersection of computational / socio-economic systems and AI/ML. 



-------------------

Topics of Interest

-------------------

The areas of interest are broadly categorized into the following three streams: 



* Systems for AI/ML (e.g., CPU/GPU architectures for AI/ML; Embedded hardware for AI/ML workloads; Data intensive systems for efficient and distributed training; Challenges in production deployment of ML systems; Efficient model training, optimization and inference; Hardware efficient ML methods; Resource-constrained ML; etc.)



* AI/ML for Systems (e.g., AI/ML for VLSI and architecture design; AI/ML in compiler optimization; AI/ML in data management - including database optimizations, virtualization, etc.; AI/ML for networks - design of networks, load modeling, etc.; AI/ML for power management - green computing, power models, etc.)



* Applications of AI/ML in Socio-Economic Systems Design (e.g., Computational design and analysis of socio-economic systems; Fair and bias-free systems for social welfare, business platforms; Applications of AI/ML in the design, short-/long-term analysis of cyber-physical systems; Mechanism design for socio-economic systems; Applications of AI/ML in financial systems; etc.)



------------

Key Dates

------------

Papers are invited under different tracks, with deadlines starting from mid-June, 2021. Authors are requested to visit the website for individual track deadlines. 



-----------------

Paper Submissions

-----------------

Research papers must not exceed 6 pages, including any appendix and bibliography. Only electronic submissions in PDF format will be considered. Page limits and formatting instructions for all remaining tracks will be announced on the conference website. Paper review will follow single-blind policy. 



The manuscripts can be submitted in PDF, formatted using ACM sigconf style through https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AIMLSystems2021



Papers can be submitted under any of the three main topics listed above. Number of papers accepted under each topic is not capped. We will accept all papers that meet the high quality and innovation levels required by the AIMLSystems conference. All papers that are accepted will appear in the proceedings. 



All accepted papers will be presented as posters at AIMLSystems 2021, but a select subset of them will be given a “conventional” (oral) presentation slot during the conference. However, all accepted papers will be treated equally in the conference proceedings, which are the persistent, archival record of the conference.



-----------------

Dual Submission Policy

-----------------

A paper submitted to AIMLSystems can not be under review at any other conference or journal during the entire time it is considered for review at AIMLSystems, and it must be substantially different from any previously published work or any work under review. After submission and during the review period, submissions to AIMLSystems must not be submitted to other conferences / journals for consideration. However, authors may publish at non-archival venues, such as workshops without proceedings, or as technical reports (including arXiv).



-----------------

Ethics

-----------------

* Plagiarism Policy: Submission of papers to AIMLSystems 2021 carries with it the implied agreement that the paper represents original work. We will follow the ACM Policy on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification -- see https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-overview. 



  All submitted papers will be subjected to a ""similarity test"". Papers achieving a high similarity score will be examined and those that are deemed unacceptable will be rejected without a formal review. Conference organizers also reserve the right to report such unacceptable submissions to the superiors of each of the authors.



* Author Participation: Submission of papers to AIMLSystems 2021 also carries with it the implied agreement that one or more of the listed authors will register for and attend the conference and present the paper. Papers not presented at the conference will not be included in the final program or in the digital proceedings.

Early in 2020, a Technology Magazine article argued “Why 2020 will be the Year of Automated Machine Learning” - reasoning that ""AutoML represents the next stage in ML’s evolution, promising to help non-tech companies access the capabilities they need to quickly and cheaply build ML applications.” What could not be foreseen is how 2020 saw the focus of AutoML, like many other efforts, turn to COVID-19:  to predict patient survival,  to predict patient mortality, to model the progression of COVID-19 deaths, and related healthcare and medical diagnosis efforts. AutoML continues to generate very current and widespread attention regarding appropriate uses, current capabilities, limitations, challenges, and future potential.



The debates continue regarding the level to which data science can and should be automated, the level of machine learning knowledge and expertise needed to build quality models, and the where and when manual intervention is necessary, yet the development and application of approaches and tools to automate repeated tasks continues to increase. The advancement, education, and adoption of data mining and machine learning practices require a transformation of theory to application, and feedback from application to theory. The development of tools to automate data mining efforts fosters this transformation and feedback and also promotes the development of standards and the adoption of these standards. Automated standards enable researchers and practitioners to better communicate, sharing successes and challenges in a more consistent common language. In an age of software as a service and ever-increasing scalability requirements, standards are necessary. Consistent adoption, application, and communication in turn promote research and refinement of the automated strategies and growth of the community. To keep pace with the rapidly increasing volume and rate of data generation, standardization and automating of data mining activities are critical. The challenges that must be discussed relate to the boundaries of automated tasks and individual attention needed for each unique business and data scenario.



The goals of the AutoML workshop are:



  ● To identify opportunities and challenges for automation in machine learning



  ● To provide an opportunity for researchers to discuss best practices for 

    automation in machine learning, potentially leading to definition of standards



  ● To provide a forum for researchers to speak out and debate on different ideas 

    in the area of automation in machine learning

Scope



Nowadays, the concept of artificial intelligence has taken the world by storm. It is generally believed that artificial intelligence will become the next technology that will disrupt the industry; In the past few years, the breakthrough of machine learning has transitioned from facial recognition, medical diagnosis, and natural language processing to all aspects of our lives, especially in the field of deep learning. In the next few years, artificial intelligence will continue to affect all aspects of our lives, including transportation, medical and financial services, etc. Especially in the field of communication. Artificial intelligence and all its derivative technologies form the key technology foundation of many advanced algorithms applied in wireless communication, and the application range is from optimization to OSI (open system interconnection) model physical layer processing. We hope that we can apply the artificial intelligence algorithm to the communication system, which can help people make more intelligent decisions in the system design, automatic operation and optimization and other core links.



We invite high-quality original research papers to describe recent and anticipated challenges or discoveries, as well as potential intelligent solutions for future mobile communications and networks. We welcome both theoretical and experimental papers.

1624305858-52,http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=artificial%20intelligence&page=19,RELATED 2021,http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=127511&copyownerid=168013,"The RELATED workshop focuses on the wide-ranging topic of relations in the legal field. Typical goals in relations studies are: ranking of normative provisions and judgments; classification of implicit and explicit links between norms; handling potential or actual conflict between technical and goal-oriented norms with recourse to mechanisms such as defeasibility and balance of principles; discovery of synonyms and near-synonyms in documents from different languages and contexts (jurisdictions, document type); discovery of instances of count-as terms and policies to facilitate analogical reasoning and compliance checking. Relations are an important aspect of many sub-disciplines of AI & Law – ontologies, logic, argumentation and network analysis. This workshop is intended to be a forum bringing together all these sub-disciplines to focus on relations from different perspectives.



The challenging task of automatically identifying relations between concepts expressed in textual documents has traditionally been addressed by NLP techniques. Once such relations are identified in the text, they can be formalized to become part of ontological models in a certain legal domain of interest. The extraction of relations between legal concepts and entities is even more pertinent when considering the increasing relevance of knowledge graphs in the Semantic Web context. For instance, applications that extract relations between norms, legal concepts and documents may look at the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud for reusing, integrating and expanding existing data on the Web.



Navigating the interplay between legal text fragments beyond terms, such as normative provisions, principles, policies, arguments, is a challenging aspect of legal reasoning. There is a rich theoretical literature on relations between norms, principles and factors. Moreover, recent years have seen important developments in the field of network analysis, particularly the identification, classification and weighting of legal citations in order to build a network of related legal sources and rank their individual importance. Less explored is the development of systems for automated identification of implicit relations between norms in terms of, for instance, conceptual similarity, motivation and conflict. Also of relevance to this workshop are topic networks, which can be useful not only for semantic grouping of legal text fragments, but also in comparing different legal documents, such as legislative texts, judgments, national strategy documents, guidelines issued by institutional bodies, and policy documents issued by companies. Contributions are welcome from NLP, machine learning, logic and argumentation.

‘Convolutional Neural Networks for Medical Image Processing Applications’

 

Living standards are increasing day by day in the light of technological developments. One of the consequences of this is that people's expectations increase. Many things can be listed among these expectations, but the most important are expectations regarding human health and life expectancy. For this reason, many studies are carried out on the use of technological developments for the benefit of human health. These medical applications may include many image processing applications such as MRI, CT, fMRI, microscopy. In addition, it includes the interpretation of many biomedical signals such as EEG, ECG, EMG. Of course, it is not possible to limit medical applications only to this. Studies on health reveal the breadth of this area. Manual methods were preferred in these areas in the past. Especially with technological developments, they left their places to automatic methods with this manual method. Today, convolutional neural network architectures, which can produce striking results in almost every field, are used in medical image processing applications.

This book includes medical image processing applications using well-designed and innovative CNN architectures. It seriously contributes to this field with different types of images and architectures specially recommended for different diseases.

The book welcomes high-quality research, survey and tutorial papers on medical image processing topics. All papers will go through a rigorous peer-review process and automated plagiarism checks. Papers must be formatted according to the specifications and limits of the proposed template.

ABOUT THE WORKSHOP



Big Data accumulating from remote sensing technology in ground, aerial, and satellite-based Earth Observation (EO) has radically changed how we monitor the state of our planet. Advanced EO sensors nowadays generate rich streams of data around the clock. An effective interpretation of the resulting complex large-scale data adopts the best machine learning techniques from signal processing, computer vision, pattern recognition, and artificial intelligence (AI).

In this workshop we aim to bring together a range of domain experts from remote sensing, geographic information systems and computer vision, researchers in the field of weather and climate modeling, as well as other scientists or engineers with a general interest of application of modern data analysis methods in the EO domain.

The focus of the workshop is to advance research in Earth observation which will form the basis for effectively addressing urgent social challenges affected by changes in our environment such as natural catastrophes or climate change.



***************************************

SCOPE AND TOPICS



The CDCEO workshop invites both method development and advanced applications in a wide range of related topics, including image and signal processing, gap-filling, data fusion, feature extraction, prediction of spatio-temporal features, and the detection of rules underlying the observed state transitions and causal relationships. The topics covered by the workshop theme include but are not limited to:



* Spatio-temporal data processing and analysis

* Multi-resolution, multi-temporal, multi-sensor, and multi-modal data fusion

* Machine learning for weather and climate research

* Deep learning and its applications to, e.g., semantic segmentation, scene classification, and feature extraction

* Advanced applications of time-series data analysis, e.g., urban sprawl, deforestation, crop monitoring, weather forecasts  

* Feature extraction, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction

WREATHER4CAST COMPETITION



Weather forecasts are of obvious immediate value, but also are an important part of EO, informing about continuing changes of our environment. Modern ML methods have recently become viable alternatives to long standing physics-based forecasting solutions.



A special session of the workshop will present the winning solutions and highlights from a unique multi-sensor weather forecasting competition. The goal of the competition is a short-term prediction of the selected weather products based on meteorological satellites data obtained in collaboration with AEMET/ NWC SAF. The competition data are presented in a form of weather movies that consist of multi-channel images encoding the cloud properties, temperature, turbulence, and rainfall.

Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is a recent paradigm emerging from Artificial Intelligence (AI), where computers are used as proactive tools assisting people with their day-to-day activities, making everyone’s life more comfortable.Another main concern of AmI originates from the human computer interaction domain and focuses on offering ways to interact with systems in a more natural way by means user friendly interfaces. This field is evolving quickly as can be witnessed by the emerging natural language and gesture based types of interaction.

 

The inclusion of computational power and communication technologies in everyday objects is growing and their embedding into our environments should be as invisible as possible. In order for AmI to be successful, human interaction with computing power and embedded systems in the surroundings should be smooth and happen without people actually noticing it. The only awareness people should have arises from AmI: more safety, comfort and wellbeing, emerging in a natural and inherent way. ISAmI is the International Symposium on Ambient Intelligence, aiming to bring together researchers from various disciplines that constitute the scientific field of Ambient Intelligence to present and discuss the latest results, new ideas, projects and lessons learned.Brand new ideas will be greatly appreciated as well as relevant revisions and actualizations of previously presented work, project summaries and PhD thesis.

Website: https://project.inria.fr/aimlai/ 

Submission link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aimlaiecml21

Submission deadline: June 24th, 2021



The purpose of AIMLAI (Advances in Interpretable Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence) is to encourage principled research that will lead to the advancement of explainable, transparent, ethical and fair data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. AIMLAI is a workshop that seeks top-quality submissions addressing uncovered important issues related to explainable and interpretable data mining and machine learning models. Papers should present research results in any of the topics of interest for the workshop as well as application experiences, tools and promising preliminary ideas. AIMLAI asks for contributions from researchers, academia and industry, working on topics addressing these challenges primarily from a technical point of view, but also from a legal, ethical or sociological perspective. Besides the central topic of interpretable algorithms and explanation methods, we also welcome submissions that answer research questions like ""how to measure and evaluate interpretability and explainability?"" and ""how to integrate humans in the machine learning pipeline for interpretability purposes?"". This year's edition of AIMLAI is open to two kinds of submissions: regular papers (8 pages, single column) presenting novel ideas, and extended abstracts (3 pages, single column) of already published works.



A non-exhaustive list of topics that are of interest for AIMLAI are the following:



    Interpretability and explanations in machine learning

        Machine learning models that are directly interpretable 

        Explanation modules for black-box models (post-hoc interpretability)

    Methodology and formalization of interpretability

        Interpretability/complexity trade-off

        Formal measures of interpretability

        Methodological guidelines to evaluate interpretability

    User-centric interpretability

        Semantic interpretability: how to add semantics to explanations?

        Human-in-the-loop to construct and/or evaluate interpretable models

        Combining of ML models with infovis and man-machine interfaces

    Transparency in AI and ML

        Ethical aspects

        Legal aspects

        Fairness issues



While interpretability and explanations for classical supervised learning models are always welcome, ideas on techniques and definitions/formalizations of these concepts in unsupervised learning are particularly welcome.



* Submission Guidelines

Papers must be written in English and formatted according to the Springer LNCS guidelines. Regular papers must be 8 pages long maximum. Extended abstracts are restricted to a maximum of 3 pages. Overlength papers will be rejected without review (papers with smaller page margins and font sizes than specified in the author instructions and set in the style files will also be treated as overlength).



Authors who submit their work to AIMLAI 2021 commit themselves to present their paper at the workshop in case of acceptance. AIMLAI 2021 considers the author list submitted with the paper as final. No additions or deletions to this list may be made after paper submission, either during the review period, or in case of acceptance, at the final camera ready stage.



Condition for inclusion in the post-proceedings is that at least one of the co-authors has (virtually) presented the paper at the workshop. Pre-proceedings will be available online before the workshop. A special issue in a relevant international journal with extended versions of the selected papers is under consideration.



All papers for AIMLAI 2021 must be submitted by using the online submission system at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aimlaiecmlpkdd21.

*********************************************** 



The problem of imbalanced domain learning has been thoroughly studied in the last two decades, with a specific focus on classification tasks. However, the research community has started to address this problem in other contexts such as regression, ordinal classification, multi-label and multi-class classification, association rules mining, multi-instance learning, data streams, time-series and spatio-temporal forecasting, text mining and multimodal data. Clearly, the research community recognises that imbalanced domains are a broad and important problem. Such a context poses important challenges for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, in an increasing number of real-world applications.



Tackling the issues raised by imbalanced domains is crucial to both academia and industry. To researchers, it is an opportunity to develop more adaptable and robust systems/approaches for very complex tasks. These tasks are, in many cases, those that industry is already facing today. These are very diverse and include the ability to prevent fraud, anticipate catastrophes, and in general to enable a more preemptive action in an increasingly fast-paced world.



This workshop proposal focuses on providing a significant contribution to the problems of learning with imbalanced domains, aiming to increase the interest and the contributions to solving its challenges. The workshop invites inter-disciplinary contributions to tackle the problems that many real-world domains face nowadays. With the growing attention that this challenge has collected, it is crucial to promote its further development in order to tackle its theoretical and application challenges.

We invite contributions to a Special Issue on AI for People, to be published by the AI & Society - Journal of Culture, Knowledge and Communication (Springer) https://www.springer.com/journal/146​



This Special Issue was born out of the idea of shaping Artificial Intelligence technology around human and societal needs.  We believe that technology should respect the anthropocentric principle. It should be at the service of the people, not vice-versa. In order to foster this idea, we need to narrow the gap between civil society and technical experts. This gap is one in knowledge, in action and in tools for change.





=============================

SPECIAL ISSUE THEMES

=============================

The ‘social good’ is something which benefits the general public, being ‘for’ the people, and at the same time, it is something which reflects and respects their wishes, being ‘from’ the people. The ‘social good’ can be envisioned as global citizens uniting to unlock the potential of individuals through collaboration to create a positive societal impact. It is about engagement, shareability and bringing people together to change the world for the better. Concurrently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) research is mature enough for stable algorithms and approaches to be used and play a crucial role in the aforementioned ‘social good’, enabling the deployment of revolutionary services and applications. It is envisioned that both the social interaction and the integration with smart devices will meaningfully impact societal development and sustainability.  

Nowadays, advances in research on AI systems have yielded a far-reaching discourse about the applicability of the AI Ethics principles when designing, developing, integrating or using AI systems. AI Ethical principles are guidelines put forward by policy makers that can act as abstractions, as normative constraints on the do’s and don’ts of algorithmic use in society. Themes of transparency, justice, and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy must be taken into account when deploying real-world AI systems.    



This Special Issue will focus on the following AI Ethics principles:  

   1. Accuracy and Robustness: algorithmic conclusions are probabilities and therefore not infallible and they also  might incur in errors during execution. This can lead to unjustified actions.  

   2. Explainability and Transparency: a lack of interpretability and transparency can lead to algorithmic systems that are hard to control, monitor, and correct. This is the commonly called ‘black-box’ issue.  

   3. Bias and Fairness: conclusions can only be as reliable (but also as neutral) as the data they are based on, and this can lead to bias. An action could be found to be discriminatory if it has a disproportionate impact on one group of people.  

   4. Privacy: algorithmic activities, like profiling, can lead to challenges for autonomy and informational privacy.    

   5. Accountability: it is hard to assign responsibility to algorithmic harms and this can lead to issues with moral responsibility.   

   6. Safety and Security: AI systems need to respect and support privacy rights and data protection while ensuring the security of data.  



The aim of this Special Issue is, however broad, mostly twofold. On one hand, it entails the technical realization of these  AI Ethics principles (one or more) in practice. For example, this might refer to specific techniques to ensure principles like ‘fairness’ in an algorithm, with their related practical challenges. On the other hand, it entails addressing these principles from a conceptual standpoint. For example, this might entail, among other things, theorizing, analysing, criticizing and/or further developing the AI principles themselves. Contributions are welcomed from a host of different disciplines, spanning from the sciences, the social sciences and the humanities.  





=============================

CONTRIBUTION TYPES

=============================

We welcome contributions across the following formats:  

   - Original​ papers (max 10k words): substantial contribution, theory, method, application. Contributions may be experimental, based on case studies, or conceptual discussions of how AI systems affect organisations, society  and humans. Original papers will be double blind peer-reviewed by two reviewers and the editorial team.    

   - Network Research papers (max 10k words): substantial contributions to theoretical and methodological foundations within societal domains. These will be multi-authored papers that include a summary of the contribution of each author to the paper. Network Research papers will be double blind peer-reviewed by two reviewers and the editorial team.    

   - Open Forum​ papers (max 8k words): research in progress, ideas paper. Contributions may come from researchers,  practitioners and others interested in the topics of the special issue. Contributions might be, but not limited to, discussion papers, literature reviews, case studies, working papers, features, and articles on emerging research. Papers published in the open forum target a broad audience i.e. academics, designers as well as the average reader.  Open Forum contributions will be double blind peer-reviewed by two reviewers and the editorial team.    

   - Student​ papers (max 6k words): research in progress. Contributions may come from post-graduate students and  Ph.D. students interested in the topics of the special issue.

Papers are double  blind peer-reviewed by one reviewer and the editorial team.    

   - Curmudgeon​ papers (max 1k words): short opinionated column on trends in technology, science and society,  commenting on issues of concern to the research community and wider society. Whilst the drive for artificial intelligence promotes potential benefits to wider society, it also raises deep concerns of existential risk, thereby highlighting the need for an ongoing conversation between technology and society. At the core of Curmudgeon concern is the question: What are the political-philosophical concepts regarding the present sphere of AI  technology? Curmudgeon articles will be reviewed by the Journal editors.

The protection of personal data and privacy is a timeless challenge which has intensified in the modern era. The digitisation that has been achieved in recent decades has radically changed the way we live, communicate and work, revealing various security and privacy issues. Specifically, the explosion of new technologies and the continuous developments of technologies, such as IoT and AI, have led to the increased value of data, while it has raised demand and introduced new ways to obtain it. Techniques such as data analysis and processing provide a set of powerful tools that can be used by both governments and businesses for specific purposes. However, as with any valuable resource, as in the case of data, the phenomena of abuse, unfair practices and even criminal acts are not absent. In particular, in recent years, there have been more and more cases of sophisticated cyberattacks, data theft and leaks or even data trade, which violate the rights of individuals, but also harm competition and seriously damage the reputation of businesses.



In this Special Issue, we seek research and case studies that demonstrate the application of advanced technologies in data and information security to support applied scientific research, in any area of science and technology. Example topics include (but are not limited to) the following:



    - Self-sovereign Identities

    - Privacy-Preserving Solutions

    - Blockchain-Based Security and Privacy

    - Data Loss Prevention

    - Deep Learning Forensics/Malware Analysis/Anomaly Detection

    - AI-driven Security Systems

    - Context-Aware Behavioural Analytics

    - Security and Data Breach Detection

    - Cyber-physical Systems Security

    - Secure and Privacy-Preserving Health Solutions

    - Active Defence Measures

    - Social Networks Information Leaks

    - Edge and Fog Computing Security

    - Anonymization and Pseudonymization Solutions

In the past few years, the world has seen a tremendous digital transformation in all of its areas. In consequence, the general public needs to be able to acquire an ever-increasing amount of digital literacy and at least some level of proficiency with modern digital tools. While modern software engineering relies heavily on Computer Assisted Software Engineering (CASE) tools and development methodologies (to improve productivity, quality, and efficiency of development teams), those tools remain targeted towards experienced practitioners and computer science remains taught in a very classical way. In the same time, the rise of artificial intelligence allows more and more easily to provide automated support, automate the processing and review of documents such as dissertations and other kinds of exercises, or to predict the needs of students.



This context seems to be a perfect opportunity to foster interesting discussions in a workshop that gathers people from many different communities (software engineering, education science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, etc.), through the common lens of how advanced software tools and techniques might be used as a catalyst for a better way to teach various types of students.



** Topics of interest **



Topics include, but are not limited to:



Tools and techniques

- Advances in automated grading of assignments.

- Advances in automated feedback and recommendations to provide support to students.

- Visualization of technical and/or scientific information in various fields (chemistry, software engineering, physics, history, sociology, etc.).

- Efforts related to the improvement of usability of advanced tools for non experienced users.

- Efforts related to inclusion of users with disabilities in the learning environment.

- Dropout prediction in a learning environment using machine learning.

- Methods with a focus on explainability and interpretability (either to students or teachers) are particularly welcome.



Methodologies

- New and unexpected usage of established software engineering practices in the education environment.

- Integration of agile methods principles in the education environment.

- Integration of software quality standards and methods dedicated to continuous improvement in the education environment.

- Application to serious game and gamification in the context of education.

- Team work or individual work in online settings or not.



Evaluations and Lessons Learned

- Feedback on case studies using cutting edge techniques, methods, and tools applied to the education environment.

- Improvement of computational thinking skills and digital literacy through software engineering.

- Improvement of critical thinking and research skills of students.

- Integration of software engineering and artificial intelligence research into teaching and training.

- Introduction to artificial intelligence and machine learning principles for younger audiences.



** Types of submissions **



We invite original papers in the conference format (ACM sigconf, double column, https://2021.esec-fse.org/track/fse-2021-how-to-submit#submission-policies) describing positions and new ideas (short papers up to 4 pages) as well as new results and reporting on innovative approaches (long papers up to 8 pages). All accepted papers will be published in the ACM digital library, together with the other ESEC/FSE workshops proceedings.



The workshop also welcomes presentations of previously peer-reviewed published papers. We will invite authors to submit a one-page extended abstract that will not be included in the proceedings.



** Important dates ** 



Paper submission: May 14th, 2021 (AoE)

Notification: June 21th, 2021 (AoE)

Camera-ready: July 5th, 2021 (AoE)



** Submission site** 



Submissions will be handled via EasyChair: link to be provided



** Modalities ** 



The workshop will run in online mode. Presenters will be invited to submit a video of their work that will be available to attendees before the workshop begins. Attendees will have the opportunity to access all available content during the week leading up to the workshop and following the end of the workshop. Lightning talk presentations will take place online during the workshop, with online question/answering and timezone mirroring.



** Review process **



The workshop will follow a single-blind peer-review process. Each contribution will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Acceptance will be jointly decided with the reviewers, based on the reviews and discussions.

As previously published papers have been already reviewed and accepted, they will not be reviewed again for technical content. If needed, the presentation’s propositions will be prioritized, based on the content and structure of the sessions."

Special Issue Information



As the demand for Internet of Things (IoT) solutions has grown over time, edge computing has gained momentum, because of the need to move computation close to data sources. Indeed, the rise of connected devices, which Gartner estimates number more than 20 quadrillions in 2020, is growing the need for computation in scenarios where prompt responses are crucial. On the other hand, the upcoming deployment of 5G networks will bring drastic performance improvements, traffic optimization, and new ultra-low-latency services in locations where cloud connectivity is too low, such as in oil platforms or cruise ships.



On the other hand, the increasing number of connected devices is also generating a huge number of raw data directly on the edge. For example, Cisco estimates that nearly 850 ZB will be generated by people, machines, and things at the network edge by 2021 [1]. That is where artificial intelligence (AI) steps in, leading data transformation in real-time extracted business value. Therefore, the migration of machine learning and deep learning techniques over to the edge enables a new field of research, where the intelligence is distributed over devices. In this context, TensorFlow has already released a tool that enables AI on the edge, but many challenges remain.



The benefits of AI on the edge are typically visible over several application fields, such as wearable technologies, smart homes, smart cities, Industry 4.0, agriculture, autonomous driving, video surveillance, social and industrial robotics, etc.



This Special Issue aims to promote high-quality research on all the aspects related to the training, inference, and migration to the edge of artificial intelligence services. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:



- Machine learning services on the edge;

- Deep learning services on the edge;

- The migration of AI-based services from the cloud into the edge;

- The optimization of real-time, AI-based solutions on the edge;

- Edge-centric distributed intelligent services;

- Edge-centric collaborative intelligent services;

- Edge-centric federated intelligent services;

- The security of data distribution over AI-based edge systems;

- Trust and privacy management in AI-based edge systems;

- The quality of services and energy efficiency for AI-based edge systems;

- AI for the IoT;

- AI for microcontroller and microprocessor.

Aims and Scope



Nowadays, the global vision is the progressive migration towards smart cities in order to enhance the citizen life and to encounter many problems induced by population growth and increased urbanization, such as traffic congestion, air pollution, ... These smart environments can be viewed as interconnection of wide-scale cyber-physical systems, with sensors monitoring cyber and physical indicators to collect diverse information from the surrounding environment and with actuators dynamically changing the complex urban environment in some way. Through such systems, many innovative applications can be proposed in several fields of activity, such as smart living, smart mobility, smart economy, smart environment and smart governance.  As the human factor is involved in many applications, verifying and proving the validity and correctness of protocols and applications are crucial steps before deployment, in addition to ensuring other paradigms such as scalability, energy saving, resource constraints, etc. In this context, several methods and approaches of Distributed Computing are exploited in software and hardware to propose new approaches able to support and analyse the huge amount of collected information and to deal with the control of these emerging networks.



The workshop aims to be a major forum for researchers and practitioners, interested in the design, development and evaluation of distributed systems, platforms and architectures for Cyber Physical Systems in the context of smart cities. Highlights of the workshop will include a high quality single-track technical program and an invited speaker.

Organized in conjunction with ICCV 2021

Montreal, Canada 11-17 October 2021

http://iccv2021.thecvf.com/



In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in aerial motion imagery due to advances in airborne sensor technologies, rising adoption of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and emergence of new applications associated with these technologies including aerial surveillance, traffic monitoring, search and rescue, disaster relief, and precision agriculture. We are witnessing a growing need for robust aerial image and video analysis capabilities to take full advantage of this data and to address the pressing needs of its applications. Novel methods, particularly those relying on artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) approaches, coupled with rapid advances in computational hardware (more powerful, lighter weight, lower energy, lower cost computing platforms) are revolutionizing the image processing, pattern recognition, and computer vision fields.



The aim of this workshop is to solicit papers from academia, government, and industry researchers with original and innovative works on all aspects of analysis of aerial motion imagery to address the needs in a diverse set of application areas. Of particular interest to this workshop is analysis of aerial wide area motion imagery (WAMI) that is characterized by very large (few square miles) ground coverage. WAMI enables large scale surveillance and monitoring for extended periods of time, but suffers from unique challenges such as hundreds to thousands of moving objects per frame, small object sizes, parallax, and lower frame rates.





Topics of interest include but are not limited to:



- Robust feature detection and matching 

- Aerial video stabilization 

- Object detection and/or recognition in aerial videos 

- Multi-object tracking 

- Multi-view object tracking 

- Persistent single object tracking 

- 3D-enabled object tracking 

- Landmark detection and recognition for aerial navigation 

- Structure-From-Motion 

- Aerial 3D reconstruction 

- Scene understanding and video summarization for aerial platforms 

- Applications of computer vision for aerial platforms 

- Embedded video processing for aerial systems 

- Multi-sensor data fusion for aerial systems 

- Deep learning for aerial image analysis 

- Video compression for aerial motion imagery 

- Synthetic scene generation for aerial applications 

- Autonomous navigation 

- Multi-UAV swarm coordination and sensing 

- Coordination of heterogeneous airborne camera systems 

- Image Fusion applied to airborne and ground-based camera systems 

- Mission planning for airborne data collection campaign

A special issue of Applied Sciences (ISSN 2076-3417; WoS JCR impact factor 2.474). This special issue belongs to the section ""Computing and Artificial Intelligence"".



Deadline for manuscript submissions: 11 January 2021.

This special issue is now open for submission. Articles will be reviewed as they submitted.



Special Issue Information:



Natural language processing and text mining technologies have experienced a revolution in the last few years, with substantial improvements in accuracy mainly due to the use of deep-learning neural networks and large pretrained models relying on huge amounts of data. Explicit representations of linguistic knowledge (such as parse trees, semantic dependencies, lexicons, linguistic rules, etc.) have lost their protagonist role in systems where neural networks perform the bulk of the task, often in an end-to-end fashion. However, it is far from guaranteed that the accuracy improvement gains from the advances in neural architectures will not plateau, as in previous occasions, highlighting the need to combine them with rich linguistic processing. Furthermore, end-to-end neural systems have limitations, especially in a context of multilingualism where low-resource languages are involved: black-box nature with limited explainability, data-induced bias, reliance on large amounts of data that may be unavailable for many of the thousands of languages existing in the world, high computational requirements, and large energy usage and contribution to global warming.



For all these reasons, approaches utilizing explicit linguistic knowledge are highly relevant and should be pursued by the research community. In this Special Issue, we thus focus on approaches to natural language processing and text mining with an emphasis on multilingualism or low-resource languages, and which include rich linguistic processing, in the sense that explicit linguistic knowledge plays a relevant role in the approach, be it exclusively or in combination with machine learning and neural approaches.

Subsequent conferences have been held in Taipei, Taiwan (2016), in Laguna Hills, California, USA (2017), Xi’an, China (2018), Singapore, Singapore (2019), and in Delhi India (virtual 2020). IEEE BigMM has fully established itself and is on a path to further broaden its audience. Jointly sponsored by the IEEE-TCMC (Technical Committee on Multimedia Computing), IEEE-TCSEM (Technical Committee on Semantic Computing), BigMM aims to establish a community of researchers from academia and industry focusing on the synergetic interactions between multimedia content and big data analytics. It is a world premier forum of leading researchers in the highly active multimedia big data research, development and applications.



Multimedia, as one of the most important and valuable sources for insights and information, is increasingly being considered as big data.” Multimedia big data includes but is not limited to text, image, graphics, audio, video, social, and sensor data that is highly valuable in decision making. It covers from everyone’s experiences to everything happening in the world. As such, multimedia big data is spurring on a tremendous amount of research and development of related technologies and applications.



The focus of the conference series has been established with the belief that it is important to have a full, top-tier conference that focuses specifically on the combination of multimedia and big data research. While research about specific aspects of big data systems is regularly published in the various proceedings and transactions of the information retrieval, operating system, real-time system, and database communities, BigMM aims to cut across these domains in the context of multimedia data types. This provides a unique opportunity to view the intersections and interplay of the various approaches and solutions developed across these domains to deal with multimedia big data types. Furthermore, BigMM provides an avenue for communicating research that addresses both multimedia and big data holistically. The mission of the conference is to share research results and solutions and to identify new issues and directions for future research and development work."

Newly developed Optical fibers and amplifiers allow direct transmission of high-speed signals over transcontinental distances without the need for electronic regeneration. Optical fibers find new applications in data processing. The impact of fiber materials, devices and systems on communications in the coming decades will create an abundance of primary literature and the need for up-to-date reviews.
  
This journal will give significant developments and in-depth surveys in the fields of fiber and integrated optics. This journal will be unique in bridging the major disciplines relevant to optical fibers and electro-optical devices. This results in a balanced presentation of basic research, system applications and economics. For more than a decade, Fiber and Optics has been a valuable forum for scientists, engineers, manufacturers and the business community to exchange and discuss techno-economic advances in the field. This will help in explaining the subject of optoelectronic devices and their use in integrated optics and fiber optic systems. The approach taken is to emphasize the physics that how devices work and how they can be (and have been) used in various applications as the field of optoelectronics has progressed from microphotonics to nanophotonics. Paper Submission     Authors are invited to submit papers for this journal through E-mail pbijjournal@airccse.org.

Computational Engineering is a modern and multidisciplinary science for computer based modeling, simulation, analysis, and optimisation of complex engineering applications and natural phenomena. Sitting at the intersection of computer science and applied math, Computational Engineering deals with mathematical techniques for modeling and simulation of complex systems; parallel programming and collaborative software development; and methods for organizing, exploring, visualizing, processing, and analyzing very large data sets. Computational Engineering englobes fundamental engineering and science, and advanced knowledge of mathematics, algorithms and computer languages.  On the other hand, Intelligent systems engineering  offers the next generation of solutions, powered by computing and artificial intelligence. Intelligent systems are technologically advanced machines that are designed to respond to some specific requirements. In Intelligent Systems Engineering, the scope is about creating systems that sense and react to their environments. 

The aim of this conference is to bring together scientists, research individuals and industrials to share knowledge abnd findings about the topics withion the scope of the conference. The purpose is to provide a platform for possible collaboration and exchange of ideas to advance more in this field.

Time series data are ubiquitous. The broad diffusion and adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) and major advances in sensor technology are examples of why such data have become pervasive. These technologies have applications in several domains, such as healthcare, finance, meteorology, and transportation. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently been used to create models that improve on the state of the art for some of these tasks.



Time series data influences both political and industrial decisions every day, yet there is, surprisingly, limited research in Machine Learning (ML) for time series - especially in situations where data is scarce or of low quality. In many real-world applications, we have the following two scenarios: 1) the amount of available training data is limited, or 2) there is a huge amount of available data which is scarcely or not labeled due to high costs of data collection and annotation.



As a result, the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be about “doing more with less”. We believe there is a need for focusing on modern AI techniques that can extract value from such challenging situations. These considerations can also contribute to the increasing need to address sustainability and privacy aspects of ML and AI. In this context, heterogeneity of the data (e.g. non-stationarity, multi-resolution, irregular sampling) as well as noise, pose further challenges.



The main scope of this workshop is to advance the state-of-the-art in time series analysis for “irregular” time series. Here, we define time series to be “irregular” if they fall under one or several of the following categories:



- Short: univariate and multivariate time series with a limited amount of data and history,

- Multiresolution: multivariate time series where each signal has a different granularity or resolution in terms of sampling frequency,

- Noisy: univariate/multivariate time series with some additional perturbation appearing in different forms. In this class, we also include time series with missing data,

- Heterogeneous: multivariate time series, usually collected by many physical systems, that exhibit different types of embedded, statistical patterns and behaviours,

- Scarcely labeled and unlabeled: univariate/multivariate time series where only a small part of the data is labeled or completely unlabeled.



*Topics

This workshop intends to offer the ideal context for dissemination and cross-pollination of novel ideas in designing machine learning models suitable to deal with irregular time series. We specifically call for contributions addressing one (or more) of the irregularity aspects mentioned above. Accordingly, topics of interest for the workshop include, but are not limited to:



- Methods for data imputation and Denoising,

- Generative models for synthetic data generation

- Transfer learning and transformer architectures for time series forecasting and classification,

- Attention mechanisms for time series forecasting

- Graph neural networks for anomaly detection and failure prediction,

- Quantification of uncertainty,

- Neural network architectures for time series classification and forecasting,

- Unsupervised and self-supervised learning for different time Series related tasks,

- Representation learning for time series,

- Few-shot learning and time series classification in a low-data regime,

- GANs for time series analysis (i.e. anomaly detection, data imputation, data augmentation, data generation, privacy),

- Physical-informed deep neural networks for time series modeling,

- (Deep) reservoir computing and spiking neural networks for time series and structured data analysis.



*Submission Guidelines

Papers must be written in English and formatted according to the Springer LNCS guidelines followed by the main conference (see templates). Regular and short papers presenting work completed or in progress are invited. 



- Regular papers are expected to provide original and innovative contributions, should not exceed 16 pages including references.

    • argumentation,

    • robotics and perception,

    • autonomous agents and multiagent systems,

    • ethical and cultural issues in AI.

We encourage all types of high-quality contributions including theoretical, engineering, and applied papers. We also encourage contributions to AI techniques in the context of established and novel application domains, such as (cyber)security, sustainability, ageing, health care, cultural heritage, manufacturing, transportation, and commerce. 

Finally, papers describing AI approaches and applications targeting societal challenges, including, for example, solutions for the mitigation and management of public health crises, as well as hot topics within the community, such as the assessment and mitigation of different kinds of biases, and in general ethical issues in AI, are particularly welcome. 

Besides regular papers presenting results not already published we also welcome short ""discussion papers"" (maximum eight pages) containing

    • descriptions of results recently published or accepted for the presentation in première international conferences and journals related to AI field;

    • position papers discussing potentially controversial topics in AI or personal points of views about specific topics in AI. 

Discussion papers are introduced as an opportunity for the authors to present their recent results to the AI community and to stimulate debate among attendees of AIxIA 2021 and potential collaborations thereof. 

At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register and attend the conference to present the work.





=== Proceedings of Regular Papers ===

Accepted regular papers will be included in the post-proceedings of the conference and will be published by Springer Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series. Authors will have the chance to revise the accepted papers according to interactions that will take place at the conference. The post-proceedings will also include selected and revised papers from thematic workshops.

Authors of selected regular papers accepted to the main track will be invited to submit an extended version for publication on ""Intelligenza Artificiale"", the International Journal of the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence, edited by IOS Press and indexed by Thomson Reuters' ""Emerging Sources Citation Index"" and Scopus by Elsevier. 





=== Proceedings of Discussion Papers ===

Discussion papers will not be included in the LNAI proceedings of the conference, and will be published on CEUR WS Proceedings upon request. Discussion papers will be presented and discussed at the conference together with regular submissions.





=== Best Papers Awards ===

The Program Committee will select the Best Student Paper and the Best Paper from the accepted regular papers. In order to be eligible for the Best Student Paper Award, at least one author must be a student.





=== Submission Instructions ===

Submitted papers should be written in English and formatted according to the Springer LNCS style. Regular papers must be original papers, which are not being submitted simultaneously for publication elsewhere. These papers should not exceed 12 pages, with any number of additional pages containing bibliographic references only.

Discussion papers report results already published or accepted for publication in international conferences, and should not exceed 8 pages with any number of additional pages containing bibliographic references only.

Special Issue ""Edge Computing Optimization Using Artificial Intelligence Methods""



The growing importance of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the ubiquitous high capacity provided by 5G technologies have brought the specter of massive quantities of data being generated and/or consumed by sensors, actuators, and smart devices. Such massive amounts of data require considerable processing power, which is available in the cloud. However, cloud-based computation and data delivery models do not allow the stringent quality of service (QoS) guarantees to be efficiently harnessed. The latter is due to the number of hops of wired networks between the data endpoints and the cloud, which leads to a significant increase in latency, which may dramatically affect real-time control and other critical systems. Moreover, forwarding all the data generated by such devices directly to the cloud may devour the network bandwidth, leading to congestion. Therefore, it is necessary that critical processing to be hosted closer to the endpoint devices, i.e., closer to the sources and sinks of the data so that data can be processed and filtered out by the time it reaches the cloud. This can be achieved through Edge Computing (EC).



Efficient, scalable, and QoS-aware placement of IoT data processing jobs in EC resources is a complex optimization problem and, currently, an active research topic. As new jobs are created, they have to be assigned computational resources dynamically, matching job requirements with the cost, reliability, location (and mobility), besides the current availability of the resources. Less critical or demanding communication jobs may be offloaded to the cloud. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to jointly tackle the problem of job placement optimization, including jobs belonging to AI-based data analytics software, constitute currently active research topics addressed by this Special Issue.



For this Special Issue, original scientific articles are welcome on the following as well as closely related topics:

- AI-based algorithms to optimize job placement in EC

- AI software architectures favoring distributed computing job placement in EC resources (e.g., Distributed Deep Neural Network architectures)

- AI-based mechanisms supporting open EC markets leveraging the participation of third-party computing resources opportunistically (e.g., parked autonomous vehicles)

- AI-based methods to optimize mobile EC resources' placement (e.g., EC capable drones)

2nd Workshop on 

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES - KI-KMU 2021



Workshop at INFORMATIK 2021, Berlin & Online, September 27th - October 1st, 2021



Website: https://www.fzi.de/en/news/ki-kmu-2021/



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





DESCRIPTION

----------------



Large-scale enterprises are still the forerunners regarding the digital transformation. Nevertheless, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) start unlocking their digital potential and catch up. According to a study conducted by the KfW (2019), 38.8% of SMEs intend to implement at least two projects concerning digital transformation and additional 28 % are thinking about such projects.



Against this background, artificial intelligence (AI) plays an increasingly important role for SMEs because according to a study conducted by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (2019) the implementation of AI is a mandatory requirement for remaining competitive in the international market. SMEs can exploit their potential in various sectors such as the optimization of distribution and logistics, increased process efficiency or more targeted advertising. Also, an increase in sustainability can be achieved through the introduction of AI as a main objective or as a side effect of other optimization potentials, e.g. by reducing costs through increased process efficiency (economic sustainability), avoiding unnecessary consumption of resources, reducing waste or reducing environmental impact, e.g. by optimizing logistics processes (ecological sustainability). Technologies, such as intelligent automatization, intelligent sensor systems or intelligent assistance systems, are of great importance in this context.



The workshop “Artificial Intelligence for small and medium-sized Enterprises” aims at bringing together researchers and operators of AI, enabling a transfer of knowledge between both groups and making AI for SMEs tangible.



The workshop focuses on two key aspects: On the one hand, research approaches should be presented having a strong link to the challenges faced by small and medium-sized enterprises concerning the topic of AI or approaches concentrating on lightweight AI applications which can be easily implemented into SMEs. On the other hand, completed or ongoing projects can be presented allowing to catch a glimpse into the effects of AI in practice and showing which challenges occur during the implementation of AI.



The target audience are researchers and SME-operators of AI in different areas of application.

Privacy and security are becoming a key concern in our digital age. Companies and organizations are collecting a wealth of data on a daily basis. Data owners have to be very cautious while exploiting the values in the data, since the most useful data for machine learning often tend to be confidential. Increasingly strict data privacy regulations such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) bring new legislative challenges to the big data and artificial intelligence (AI) community. Many operations in the big data domain, such as merging user data from various sources for building an AI model, will be considered illegal under the new regulatory framework if they are performed without explicit user authorization.



In order to explore how the AI research community can adapt to this new regulatory reality, we organize this one-day workshop in conjunction with the 30th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI'21). The workshop will focus on machine learning systems adhering to the privacy-preserving and security principles. Technical issues include but not limit to data collection, integration, training and modelling, both in the centralized and distributed setting. The workshop intends to provide a forum to discuss the open problems and share the most recent and ground-breaking work on the study and application of secure and privacy-preserving compliant machine learning. Both theoretical and application-based contributions are welcome. The FL-series workshops seek to explore new ideas with particular focus on addressing the following challenges:



- Security and Regulation Compliance: How to meet the security and compliance requirements? Does the solution ensure data privacy and model security?

- Collaboration and Expansion Solution: Does the solution connect different business partners from various parties and industries? Does the solution exploit and extend the value of data while observing user privacy and data security?

- Promotion & Empowerment: Is the solution sustainable and intelligent? Does it include incentive mechanisms to encourage parties to participate on a continuous basis? Does it promote a stable and win-win business ecosystem?



We welcome submissions on recent advances in privacy-preserving, secure machine learning and artificial intelligence systems. All accepted papers will be presented during the workshop. At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to represent it at the workshop. Topics include but not limit to:



Techniques

- Adversarial learning, data poisoning, adversarial examples, adversarial robustness, black box attacks

- Architecture and privacy-preserving learning protocols

- Automated federated learning

- Federated learning and distributed privacy-preserving algorithms

- Federated transfer learning

- Human-in-the-loop for privacy-aware machine learning

- Incentive mechanism and game theory

- Privacy aware knowledge driven federated learning

- Privacy-preserving techniques (secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, secret sharing techniques, differential privacy) for machine learning

- Responsible, explainable and interpretability of AI

- Security for privacy

- Trade-off between privacy and efficiency

- Heterogeneous computing systems for federated learning



Applications

- Approaches to make AI GDPR-compliant

- Crowd intelligence

- Data value and economics of data federation

- Open-source frameworks for distributed learning

- Safety and security assessment of AI solutions

- Solutions to data security and small-data challenges in industries

- Standards of data privacy and security

- Position, perspective, and vision papers are also welcome.

Their key trait is that they pursue and achieve their more or less explicitly defined goals independently and without human guidance or intervention. In contexts where safety or other critical properties need to be guaranteed, it is, however, hardly possible at present to exploit autonomous systems to their full potential. Unknowns and uncertainties are induced due to high complexity of the autonomous behaviors, the utilized technology, and the volatile and highly complex system context in which AS operate. These characteristics render the base assumptions of established assurance methodologies (and standards) insufficient and make it necessary to investigate new approaches at runtime/operation.



One promising approach for building dependable autonomous systems is to design such systems with the capability to identify, assess, and control risks. Implementing such Dynamic Risk Management (DRM) entails many challenges concerning the necessary self-awareness and context awareness. On the one hand, powerful and thus complex self-awareness and context awareness are necessary to minimize risks, resolve conflicting objectives, and make acceptable trade-off decisions. On the other hand, the complexity of the models hinders the assurance of critical properties and prevents gaining sufficient confidence in DRM. DRM has the potential to not only enable certain types of systems or applications outright, but also to significantly increase the performance of already existing ones. This is due to the fact that by resolving unknowns and dealing with uncertainties at runtime, it will be possible to get rid of worst-case assumptions that are typically detrimental to a system’s performance properties.



The DREAMS workshop intends to explore concepts and techniques for realizing DRM. It invites experts, researchers, and practitioners to give presentations and take part in in-depth discussions about prediction models for risk identification, integration between strategic, tactical, and operational risk management, architectures for dynamic risk management, and Validation&Verification of dynamic risk management.



DREAMS aims at bringing together communities from diverse disciplines, such as safety engineering, runtime adaptation, system reconfiguration, predictive modeling, and control theory, and from different application domains such as automotive, healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture, and critical infrastructures.



Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:



DRM concepts and methods (e.g., methods for deriving suitable risk metrics)

DRM architectures

Layered DRM approaches combining different scopes (e.g., combining DRM at the trajectory planning level and at the maneuver planning level)

Collaborative DRM performed by groups of cyber-physical systems

AI-based DRM and trustworthiness considerations

DRM classifications and taxonomies
