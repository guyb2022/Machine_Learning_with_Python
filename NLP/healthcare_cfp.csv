“Partnership working in community-based health promotion can bring about fruitful and sustainable benefits for those involved. Although it takes some time to nurture relationships, when facilitated effectively, collaborative work can enable more systemic ways of working towards health promotion and community development.”



Successful partnership is essential for collaborative health design research in both clinical and community settings. Engaging community, clinical, or organizational partners often leads to diverse perspectives, access to a wider range of resources and participants, and access to different types of expertise. Much of the literature across HCI notes the benefits of collaboratively engaging end users in health design, and a select few studies have examined benefits of engaging clinical healthcare personnel and community advocates as stakeholders in design. While codesign with intended end users has become an area well explored in the pervasive health and HCI spaces, in-depth explorations of the challenges and experiences of collaborative design research with community, clinical, and organizational partners is an area that deserves attention. Additionally, as building these partnerships can be challenging, there is a need to establish best practices in this research approach. The objective of this workshop is to share collective knowledge of how to build and sustain successful and mutually beneficial collaboration with community, clinical, and organizational partners when engaging in codesign health research.



***



Workshop Goals



The objective of this workshop is to establish a working set of strategies and approaches to engaging clinical, community, and organizational partners in codesign research. Participants will share experiences and best practices for engaging different community and clinical stakeholders in the design of healthcare technologies. Our goal is to understand the first-hand experiences and perspectives of different stakeholders (designers, developers, community members, organizations) involved in collaborative design of healthcare solutions. We seek to reflect on critical questions related to codesign partnerships in health research such as:



What are the benefits and challenges of partnering with different types of stakeholders in healthcare design (community, clinical, interdisciplinary team members)?

- What are examples of successful partnerships and collaborations? What do these look like?

- What are strategies for building and sustaining mutually beneficial partnerships and collaborations?

- How do we create true environments for collaboration? How can we support understanding of different roles and needs among stakeholders involved?

- How do we manage dissemination to different venues and organizations? How can we leverage partnership to maximize research impact?



Thus, the overall objectives of the workshop are to:



Foster a deeper understanding of the dynamics of building partnerships and collaborations for healthcare design research.

Share common challenges and strategies for overcoming challenges when building and partnering with clinical and community stakeholders.

Establish an initial set of best practices for engaging clinical and community partners is design research.

Initiate a dialogue around how to implement these strategies and best practices through future research



***



Submission Instructions



We invite workshop participation through contributions that respond to one or more of the following research questions in 4-5 pages using the ACM 2-column format:



- What are strategies for building mutually beneficial partnerships?

- How do we overcome challenges in partnership relationships?

- How do we sustain partnerships overtime?

- What are useful dissemination strategies for maximizing research impact?

- How do we overcome the challenges of sharing across disciplines and to the public?



We ask that authors describe their process of creating partnership, lessons learned, and reflections of how to improve moving forward. We will also consider research setting and types of collaborations/partnerships described in an attempt to invite participants that can share diverse experiences and perspectives. Workshop Papers will be published in a dedicated section of the Pervasive Health Conference Proceedings.

To succeed in transforming healthcare, many countries will need to 

move to more targeted healthcare. Successful migration must encourage 

innovation, provide access to more complete patient information and 

incorporate advanced clinical knowledge into clinical decision-making. 

Aiming at successfully transforming healthcare, some interdependent 

challenges need to be overcome, such as prevalence of tightly coupled 

applications and data; inadequate data and knowledge standards; 

insufficient analytics capabilities; unsatisfactory security and 

privacy methodologies; absence of a clinical decision-making foundation. 

Knowledge discovery and data mining techniques, especially data 

analytics, have been proven holding much promise for solving these 

problems. Providers can use health care data analytics to learn about 

patient populations, enhance preventive care and drive business 

decisions by accessing key data such as demographics and chronic 

conditions. Therefore, nowadays the healthcare industry requires a much 

more open, robust health information technology environment than ever 

existed, especially the techniques and methodologies in knowledge 

discovery and data mining.



Targeting on these interesting questions, the workshop focuses on how 

data analytics can improve information management in healthcare. The 

workshop will bring together researchers from different countries and 

regions to foster dissemination, increase the share of knowledge cross 

different domains, and strengthen the research on data analytic 

techniques and related applications to healthcare problems.

Website:http://miccai-clip.org/ 

============================== 

========================================== 



SCOPE 



Over the past few years, there has been considerable and growing interest in the development and evaluation of new translational image-based procedures in the modern hospital. For a decade or more, a proliferation of meetings dedicated to medical image computing has created a need for greater study and scrutiny of the clinical application and validation of such methods. New attention and new strategies are essential to ensure a smooth and effective translation of computational image-based techniques into the clinic. For these reasons and to complement other technology-focused MICCAI workshops on computer assisted interventions, CLIP2013’s major focus is on translational research filling the gaps between basic science and clinical applications.

A highlight of this year’s workshop is the subject of strategies for patient-specific and anatomical modeling to support planning and interventions. Members of the medical imaging community are encouraged to submit work centered on specific clinical applications, including techniques and procedures based on comprehensive clinical image data. The event aims to bring together world-class researchers and clinicians to present ways to strengthen links between computer scientists and engineers, and surgeons, interventional radiologists and radiation oncologists. Authors are expected to highlight the clinical relevance of their work, validation methodology and integration into clinical workflow. Submissions related to applications already in use and evaluated by clinical users are particularly encouraged.





TOPICS 



* Strategies for patient-specific and anatomical modeling to support planning and interventions

* Clinical studies employing advanced image-guided methods

* Clinical translation and validation of image-guided systems

* Current challenges and emerging techniques in image-based procedures 

* Identification of parameters and error analysis in image-based procedures

* Multimodal image integration for modeling, planning and guidance

* Clinical applications in open and minimally invasive procedures 





PAPER SUBMISSION 



Papers will be limited to eight pages following the MICCAI submission guidelines. Prospective authors should refer to the Paper Submission section on the workshop website for details on how to submit papers to be presented at the workshop. 

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 2 members of the program committee. The selection of the papers will be based on the significance of results, novelty, technical merit, relevance and clarity of presentation. Papers will be presented in a day long single track workshop starting with plenary sessions. 

Accepted papers will be published as a post-proceedings volume in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series after the workshop. 



WORKSHOP FORMAT 



Accepted papers will be presented in a day long single track workshop. The final program will consist of invited speakers and original papers with time allocated for discussions. Electronic proceedings will be arranged for all of the papers presented at the workshop.

The last decade has seen unprecedented growth in the availability and size of digital health data, including electronic health records, genetics, and wearable sensors. These rich data sources present opportunities to develop and apply machine learning methods to enable precision medicine. The aim of this workshop is to engender discussion between machine learning and clinical researchers about how statistical learning can enhance both the science and the practice of medicine.



Of particular interest to this year’s workshop is a phrase recently coined by the British Medical Journal, ""Big Health Data"", where the focus is on modeling and improving health outcomes across large numbers of patients with diverse genetic, phenotypic, and environmental characteristics. The majority of clinical informatics research has focused on narrow populations representing, for example, patients from a single institution or sharing a common disease, and on modeling clinical factors, such as lab test results and treatments. Big health considers large and diverse cohorts, often reaching over 100 million patients in size, as well as environmental factors that are known to impact health outcomes, including socioeconomic status, health care delivery and utilization, and pollution. Big Health Data problems pose a variety of challenges for standard statistical learning, many of them nontraditional. Including a patient’s race and income in statistical analysis, for example, evokes concerns about patient privacy. Novel approaches to differential privacy may help alleviate such concerns. Other examples include modeling biased measurements and non-random missingness and causal inference in the presence of latent confounders.



PAPER TOPICS



We will invite submission of two­ page abstracts (not including references) for poster contributions and short oral presentations describing innovative machine learning research on relevant clinical problems and data. Topics of interest include but are not limited to models for diseases and clinical data, temporal models, Markov decision processes for clinical decision support, multi­scale data-­integration, modeling with missing or biased data, learning with non-stationary data, uncertainty and uncertainty propagation, non ­i.i.d. structure in the data, critique of models, causality, model biases, transfer learning, and incorporation of non-clinical (e.g., socioeconomic) factors.



SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:



Researchers interested in contributing should upload an extended abstract of 4 pages in PDF format to the MLCB submission web site: 



https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nips16mlhc



by October 28, 2016, 11:59pm (time zone of your choice).



No special style is required. Authors should use the NIPS style file, and submissions should be suitably anonymized and meet the requirements for double-blind reviewing. 



All submissions will be anonymously peer reviewed and will be evaluated on the basis of their technical content. The workshop allows submissions of papers that are under review or have been recently published in a conference or a journal. Authors should state any overlapping published work at time of submission.

Because the healthcare industry is the largest sector of almost every economy, healthcare organizations’ efforts to turn themselves into better competitors are attracting growing attention across the globe. The GCHSE 2014 will shed light on the role of healthcare systems engineering in this endeavor.



The GCHSE 2014 is a highly anticipated conference due to the popularity of the field. The GCHSE is set to become an exciting event with the potential for continued growth throughout the years. The GCHSE will be a forum for academics, managers and solution providers, which brings together researchers and practitioners from all over the world, promoting opportunities to share experiences, debate ideas, identify tendencies, and introduce the latest developments in the largely multidisciplinary field of Healthcare Systems Engineering. This is especially important since this field can largely benefit from increased collaboration.



The GCHSE 2014 will be held at Istanbul Technical University, Management Faculty, Macka Campus on August 5-8, 2014. Istanbul Technical University prides itself on being the third oldest university in the world.



Istanbul is the only city in the world built on two continents. Its rich history has given it a multitude of museums, historical buildings and mosques, Byzantine churches and Roman aqueducts. This exciting venue is alive with the hustle and bustle of business and trade which for centuries has made it a vital trading hub between east and west. Straddling Europe and Asia, Istanbul is the largest and most monumental city in Turkey, and is a melting pot of cultures which mix harmoniously on both sides of a city split geographically by the Bosphorus strait. This bustling city is home to over 13 million people, and from 5 to 8 August 2014, will also be home to the GCHSE 2014."

These solutions aim to find new ways to obtain a better integration of the information technology in everyday life devices and activities. 



AmI environments are integrated by several autonomous computational devices of modern life ranging from consumer electronics to mobile phones. Ideally, people in an AmI environment will not notice these devices, but they will benefit from the services these solutions provide them. Such devices are aware of the people present in those environments by reacting to their gestures, actions and context. Recently the interest in AmI environments has grown considerably due to new challenges posed by society, demanding highly innovative services, such as vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), e-Health, Internet of Things and Home Automation among others. The main focus of this edition of the UCAmI Conference will be ""Ambient Intelligence: Sensing, Processing and Using Environmental Information"".

Call for Papers

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders of the aging human brain, clinically presenting with early memory deficit and progressive cognitive and functional disorientation. In the early stages memory loss is mild, but with late-stage AD individuals lose the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to their environment. Therefore, the healthcare needs for individuals affected with the disease vary as they progress from mild cognitive decline to severe cognitive impairment.

The brain has 100 billion nerve cells (neurons) and each nerve cell connects with many others to form communication networks. Two abnormal structures called plaques and tangles are prime suspects in damaging and killing nerve cells. 

•	Plaques are deposits of a protein fragment called beta-amyloid that build up in the spaces between nerve cells. 

•	Tangles are twisted fibers of another protein called tau that build up inside cells. 

Though most people develop some plaques and tangles as they age, those with AD tend to develop far more. They also tend to develop them in a predictable pattern, beginning in areas important for memory before spreading to other regions. Scientists have not yet determined the specific role of plaques and tangles in AD. Most experts believe they play a critical role in blocking communication between nerve cells and hence, disrupt processes that cells need to survive. 

Currently, there is no cure for AD. Many biomarkers have been developed in order to diagnose and predict progression of the disease. So far, most of them do not provide consistent results. The research is still at an early stage and hence cannot provide objective and reliable measures of disease progression in order to begin early available therapies and prepare the families and social environment for their care process.

Since people with AD cannot carry out normal activities, they require 24/7 care. The financial burden of this care-process is a threat to the economy of any country.

Papers describing original research on both theoretical and practical aspects in the use of healthcare technologies in the care of the disease are solicited for this workshop. Success stories are also welcome to be shared in this platform.

 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following: 

•Tools for early diagnosis

•Advances in the diagnostic process

•Nonintrusive behaviour monitoring with wireless sensor network

•Use of neurosensors in brain health and neurodegeneration study

•EEG and related physiological signals analysis for disease progression

•Multimedia analysis with MRI and PET images

•Knowledge discovery from experimental data 

•Metabolomics analysis

•Grids and cloud computing support for AD

•ANN tools to support clinical decision making and disease classification and prediction of MCI and AD

•Monitoring brain health for proactive measures

•Predictive models for MCI and AD

•Technology support for the caregiver

•Safety and security technologies for AD patient’s care at home

•Current research for AD biomarkers 

•Care management technologies

•Affordable Care Act and its effects on the dementia population

•Future of health care technology

•Clinical care models

Papers should contain original work not published or currently under review elsewhere. Manuscripts are limited to 8 pages. EasyChair will be used for paper submission. All papers accepted for this workshop will be included in the ICTH 2015 proceedings, which will be published by Elsevier Science in the open-access Procedia Computer Science series on-line.

Future networked information systems will support, for example, clinical workflow, remote diagnosis and consultation, e-prescribing, and mobile data collection and surveillance, disease outbreak identification and patient participation in their own well-being and care. Mobile-computing technology may be particularly helpful in improving access to healthcare (geography, monetary and informational), by encouraging personal health management, and by enabling patient and provider mobility. Wearable medical devices are emerging, to measure essential vital signs like pulse, respiration, ECG, blood glucose level, and patient mobility. Handheld devices support clinicians in urban hospitals, and portable diagnostic kits allow remote healthcare teams to more easily reach rural villages.



The widespread availability of mobile phones, and recent experiments with low-cost, long-range broadband wireless networks, bring connectivity to all these opportunities. We encourage papers that present novel ideas for networked computing technology in support of healthcare, and which are likely to invoke thoughtful discussion at the workshop.

With everyone's health and safety in mind, we are adapting some of the ways in which IARIA conferences are organized:



1. The submission deadlines (and other dates such as notification and camera ready) are rather flexible in order to account for possibly limited author access to the academic/industrial premises where the research work is taking place.



2. During the conference, authors will be able to present their work via pre-recorded videos and/or conference calls (in case they opt to avoid travel).



3. The diligent peer-review process will operate normally and the proceedings of the conference will be timely issued in order to not affect any particular scientific need (graduation, research reports, budget reports, and preparing for grant submissions).



4. Selection of awarded papers and invitations for expanded versions for IARIA journals are not affected by the presentation method (pre recorded or in person)



5. Potential postponement and relocation of events will be decided by the logistics on a case by case basis and depending on government and/or health organization regulations and recommendations.



We wish you health and safety during these tough times.



Looking forward to your cooperation!

Energy and Mobility Services

The energy sector continues to undergo substantial structural changes. Currently, the expanding usage of renewable energy sources (RES), the decentralization of energy supply and the market penetration of electric vehicles have a significant impact on the future development of services in energy and mobility. In the energy sector, for instance, the share of self-generated electricity in the overall electricity demand steadily increases. Consequently, utilities are transforming their business models from pure delivery of energy to tangible (energy) service providers. While services for the energy sector were traditionally considered technical affordances (e.g., ancillary services), the recent increase in “prosumption” shows that the need for a set of tangible, non-technical services in the energy retail market, taking consumer engagement into consideration, is no longer an issue of future services, but current reality. Moreover, the increasing volatility and uncertainty of power supply lead to a rising demand for flexibility, which cannot be provided by the conventional supply side alone. Services focusing on the demand side such as appropriate incentives (e.g. electricity tariffs), market designs, and service level concepts need to be developed and introduced. This requires new services in electricity retail markets, innovative marketing and comprehensive acceptance research and the investigation of future business models. Moreover, the concept of service quality needs to be adapted to these developments and appropriate service level indicators need to be developed. Electric vehicles might be a part of this concept. Furthermore, mobility and other services are required in order to simplify the market run-up and user acceptance of EV. This pillar therefore seeks contributions enhancing the understanding of the future role of services in energy economics and e-mobility. Moreover, presentations and papers addressing the appropriate use of decision support methods in different phases of service innovation and marketing in these domains are welcome. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to: 

•	Service innovation, marketing and evaluation in energy economics and e-mobility 

•	Service level engineering in electricity retail markets 

•	Services for mobility 2.0 

•	The role of smart grids and smart markets to foster demand-side flexibility 

•	User acceptance analysis of new tariffs (e.g. curtailable load or dynamic pricing) or new technologies (e.g. e-mobility) 

•	Design and evaluation of business models in energy and mobility markets 





Healthcare Services

Demographic changes cause higher patient demands alongside severe cost pressure and increasing quality requirements. Therefore, more efficient healthcare services and logistics are desirable. Even though underlying planning problems in the area of Operations Research resemble the ones from other service or manufacturing industries (e.g., scheduling of different tasks, processes or appointments) healthcare services are especially challenging, because patients need different care than, for example, parts of cars. In addition, particularly interdisciplinary approaches are necessary for research on and improvement of healthcare services. Since Information Systems have high potentials for improving efficiency, they also play an important role. 

For this track, practitioner submissions are explicitly encouraged in order to enable fruitful discussions on current challenges and possible solutions. Relevant topics or case studies include, but are not limited to: 



•	Operations Research for Healthcare Services, e.g. Appointment Planning, Ambulance Planning / EMS Planning, Home Healthcare Planning, Long-term Care Planning

•	Hospital Logistics

•	Health Services Research

•	Hospital Information Systems and Telemedicine Systems





Participation & Crowd Services

Today, crowd-based and participatory approaches are playing an increasingly important role in tackling innovative endeavors. Thus, platforms in the areas of open innovation, crowdfunding, participatory budgeting, crowdsourcing, idea markets are used by a broad set of organizations to facilitate innovation processes and enhance engagement of people who effected by their outcomes. Governmental organizations involve citizens, companies their wider staff, others engage parties from outside of their organization in strategic, direction setting activities. The employed approaches contribute to the generation, conceptualization, evaluation, funding, implementation, and increased acceptance of related projects. However, there is a lack of interdisciplinary research for understanding cognitive and collaborative processes that underpin these platforms, design options for approaches and their appropriateness for different settings and goals.



This track aims to shed light on the understanding and design of participatory and crowd-based approaches in the area of innovative endeavors. For this workshop we welcome research-in-progress papers and papers outlining research designs including early indicative results. Relevant topics or case studies include, but are not limited to: 

•	Crowd Services: Crowdfunding, Crowdwork, Crowdsourcing, Strategy Crowdsourcing, Participatory Budgeting, Idea Markets

•	Open Innovation

•	Disentangling and understanding participant and facilitator behavior

•	Analyzing social interaction and social network structures

•	Design of Crowd Services and related platform concepts

•	Metrics of quality and assessment 

•	Boundaries and limitations of crowd services





Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things

Market competitiveness as well as new technology developments raise the need for constantly reshaping and improving the organizational, controlling and manufacturing aspects of the lifecycle of products and services. Production industries are increasingly characterized by individualized customer needs shaping not only the final result but also the actual design, development, manufacturing and delivery process steps, as well as the associated business models. Furthermore, flexibility, customization and the need to be able to support real-time scenarios are crucial in order to be able to keep up to date with current developments. These requirements aim to be addressed by Industry 4.0 – a vision of tomorrow's manufacturing, where in intelligent factories, machines and products communicate with each other, cooperatively driving production. 



Key technological pillars for realizing Industry 4.0 are cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Internet of Services, which together facilitate the vision of the Smart Factories. Cyber-physical systems represent, control and monitor the actual physical processes, by creating a virtual copy of the physical world and making decentralized autonomous decisions. Facilitated by the Internet of Things, which refers to a worldwide network of interconnected heterogeneous objects that are uniquely addressable and are based on standard communication protocols, these intelligent autonomous systems are able to communicate with each other and with humans in real time. Furthermore, via the Internet of Services, both internal and cross-organizational services are offered and utilized by participants of the value chain. Finally, in the current era of digitalization, such scenarios are unthinkable without the utilization of Big Data technologies, where large data sets provided by the interconnected objects can be stored, managed and analyzed with scalable methods. Naturally, the employment of these technologies is associated with the need to evolve and develop new adequate business models. 



This tracks aims on discussing advantages of particular technologies, value creation and business models for platform providers, application developers, end-users, large and small organizations, and manufacturers in the context of product and service offering. Relevant topics or case studies include, but are not limited to: 

•	Self-organizing and autonomous systems 

•	Design and development of Industry 4.0 platforms 

•	Supporting solutions for customized products 

•	Monitoring and Smart Data Analytics for Industry 4.0 

•	Flexible and scalable data management and integration

•	Real-time data integration and processing

•	Sensor data processing and integration 

•	Semantic Web technologies for Industry 4.0 and IoT

•	Marketplaces for offering IoT-based applications and services 

•	Data-centric business models

•	Application and use case deployment success stories"

Assisted living (AL) is the use of information and communication technologies in a person's daily living and working environment to enable them to stay active longer, remain socially connected, and live independently into old age. AL is strongly related to other concepts such as electronic health (e-health), mobile health (m-health), and smart health (s-health). AL aims to provide assistive solutions for people with a wide range of physical, age-related, and cognitive challenges. AL uses sensing technology embedded in objects, or in the environment or worn on the person to promote health and enhance well-being, or to help maintain an independent life at home and other context-aware environments. The data gathered by sensors is analysed to detect activity and infer knowledge about the physical, cognitive, or affective state of the person, recognising and classifying patterns, detecting trends and unusual or anomalous behaviour, and healthy habits fostering. Designing effective, usable, and intelligent interfaces for AL systems requires understanding and supporting user cognitive and affective processes as well as the expression and perception of these processes in multiple modalities. The combination of computational intelligence methods with advanced software engineering technologies is crucial for handling a big amount of health-related data and making AL systems work efficiently while ensuring security and privacy of collected data.

Tentative publication date: Late 2019



ABSTRACT:

This book is aiming to present challenging issues and current trends for designing fall detection systems using multimodal approach. In healthcare, falls are frequent especially among elderly people and it is considered a major health problem worldwide. Recently, fall detection systems have been proposed to alleviate this problem and to reduce the time a person fallen receives assistance.



AIMS AND SCOPE:

The edited book is proposed to have two covering directions: (i) present novel methods and techniques to handle fall detection using a multimodal approach over a common public dataset, and (ii) reviews and surveys on multimodal fall detection.



This call for book chapters is seeking for contributions in any of the two directions. Following, there is a more descriptive explanation of each direction:



(i) Novel methods and techniques on a common dataset. 

This direction refers to implement novel algorithms and techniques using a multimodal approach on a common dataset. The idea is to present different alternatives (i.e. benchmark methods) to develop fall detection systems using the same data. We provide the Multimodal Fall Detection dataset which is a public and large dataset gathered for benchmarking purposes. 



If you select this direction, you have to propose a novel strategy to detect fallings using this dataset and the chapter should be written based on the methodology and results you obtained.



The UP Multimodal Fall Detection dataset can be found in: 

https://sites.google.com/up.edu.mx/challenge-up-2019/



NOTE: This edited book is related to the Open Competition UP Challenge 2019: Multimodal Fall Detection which is available in the previous link. To write a chapter book it is not mandatory to participate in the competition, but you can choose to do both at the same time.



(ii) Reviews and surveys.

This direction refers to make a significant review on the methodologies implemented for fall detection systems focusing on multimodal approaches. Surveys on previous works, summary of challenges in fall detection and a scientific sound future trends in this field can be submitted. If you opt for this direction, it is not mandatory to use the dataset nor to participate in the competition.

A combination of design (e.g. Interaction Design, Product Design), engineering (e.g. assistive robotics, wearables) and system (e.g. data management, distributed interventions) approaches to pervasive healthcare should deliver a better quality of care and quality of life to the patients. This workshop is about debating projects (as part of a Pervasive Healthcare System – PHS) that encourage and support patients into adopting better lifestyles to improve their condition, and into practicing better self-management. This could be done with interventions to stimulate long-lasting effects on patient motivation, affects and engagement. The medical benefits of such an approach are also of relevance, notably improvement of medication compliance and reduction of the patients’ demand on health services (visits to the hospital clinics, and interaction with healthcare professionals for routine issues).

Hence, there

is a growing demand for technological solutions for the purpose of prevention, diagnosis and rehabilitation, not only to support clinicians, but also to

enable patients to self-manage their health and wellbeing. Computer Vision is well placed to provide such solutions. In the last decade, enormous

advances have been made with regard to automated and reliable recognition of image or video content, such as face, object and motion recognition,

and gesture and activity recognition. Additionally, the affordability of modern depth sensors, such as the Microsoft Kinect, Asus Xtion Pro live,

PrimeSense Carmine and Leap Motion, represent a huge leap forward, enabling 3D modelling and body pose estimation in real time with low cost and

mostly simple setup solutions. In active and assisted living (AAL), the aim is to develop intelligent environments within which people’s health can be

monitored and assistance can be provided to deliver comfort, safety and eHealth services, among others.



Binary sensors were traditionally deployed, however they are limited in their ability to help with complex scenarios, while visual sensors, either located

in the environment or worn by the person, provide a richer modality to analyse the person’s activities and the environment. In healthcare, non-intrusive

visual sensors may estimate and track the human body’s physical state to provide real-time feedback to clinicians and/or support interactive and

stimulating rehabilitation activities. As such, computer vision, pattern recognition and machine learning techniques are gaining popularity in healthcare

and assisted living solutions. The aim of this Special Issue is to provide a platform for presenting those techniques and applications.

The past decade has brought about a dramatic increase in the deployment of simulation-based techniques in medicine and its related healthcare fields. We use simulation scenarios extensively for training of medical personnel, students, first responders, and emergency response coordinators. Rapid advances in computer technologies, biomedical and systems engineering, drive the development of cyber physical systems that serve as simulation based training platforms. Such integrated engineering and scientific methods are also the basis for design and development of new medical devices whose reliability, safety, and cybersecurity are paramount for the well-being of patients. In addition, very complex models “digitally” plan pharmaceutical studies, assess potential treatment modalities, and carry out analytics on big health related data sets. It is clear that we need to strengthen methodological and theoretical foundations in order to provide integrated, connected, and cross-cutting solutions for modeling and simulation in healthcare. This meeting will unify approaches for such solutions and “connect” researchers, developers, and medical practitioners in an attempt to further advance the simulation modeling agenda in medicine.



TOPICS

The meeting will focus on (but will not be limited to) the following topical areas:

• Modeling and simulation in medicine: fundamental research

• Training and education

• Care delivery, outcomes, and patient’s safety

• Robotics and its applications in training and “in vivo”

• Life-critical systems

• Systems integration: “connected health”

• Cybersecurity of medical IT systems and devices

• Data science for health predictive analytics

We solicit papers to address the above and related areas with focus on both the underlying methodological and theoretical foundations and practical applications.

The overall goal of the Pervasive Health Conference is to take a multidisciplinary approach to Pervasive Healthcare Technology research and development. The Pervasive Healthcare Community is addressing a broad scope of research topics and concerns:



    identify and understand problems from a technological, social, and medical perspective (with a particular emphasis on understanding and supporting patient needs);

    design, implementation, and evaluation of supporting hardware and software infrastructures, algorithms, and applications; and

    organisational strategies that facilitate integration of Pervasive Healthcare Technology into the healthcare enterprise.



Traditional healthcare environments are extremely complex and challenging to manage, as they are required to cope with an assortment of patient conditions under various circumstances with a number of resource constraints. Pervasive healthcare technologies seek to respond to a variety of these pressures by successfully integrating them within existing health care environments. Technologies, standards and procedures on their own provide little and or no meaningful service. It is essential that pervasive healthcare environments, through a combined approach of data collection, data correlation and data presentation, assist health care professionals in delivering high levels of patient care, and empower individuals and their families for self-care and health management.



The Pervasive Healthcare conference in Oldenburg aims to gather technology experts, practitioners, industry and international authorities contributing towards the assessment, development and deployment of pervasive medical based technologies, standards and procedures.



We welcome contributions from the following fields:

Camera Ready Proceedings Revision Deadline: TBD

Workshop: Either Friday or Saturday, Dec 13-14, 2019





Topics:

We invite submissions from all areas of machine learning for health and biomedicine but we especially encourage submissions that focus on this year’s theme: What makes machine learning in medicine different?



Example focus areas include, but are not limited to, the following:



Data and Labels are Noisy and/or Missing 

Healthcare data suffers from very high rates of noise and missingness, both in terms of input data as well as in terms of labels. Therefore, methods such as noise-robust models, data imputation, semi-supervised learning, distant/weak supervision, and clinician in the loop learning, all have an important role to play in machine learning for healthcare.



Causality / Confounding

Causality is central to any interventional task within healthcare, and methods to learn causal structures from observational data or to account for additional confounding within data are critical in healthcare.



Do No Harm: Trust, Generalizability, Interpretability, & Reproducibility

Machine learning models in healthcare need to demonstrate robustness, pass a high bar of trust before deployment and be routinely validated. This places strong burdens on tests of generalizability (to assert the model will extend to novel patients), interpretability (to provide auxiliary arguments in favor of the models’ correctness), and reproducibility (to ensure the model can be trusted, audited, and debugged).



Deployment Challenges within Healthcare

Deploying a machine learning model in healthcare faces significant hurdles and requires additional socio-technical validation and control mechanisms. In addition, models models deployed in healthcare may face regulatory challenges.



Dataset Shift

Healthcare policy, new clinical knowledge or even the deployment of models to production can fundamentally change the process machine learning algorithms intend to model. For example, numerous examples have shown that when CMS increases the reimbursement for a particular diagnosis, the diagnosis is used in claims more frequently.



Fairness & Bias

Fairness concepts are important in healthcare, for example in ensuring all patients receive unbiased treatment, and especially difficult to respect, as protected subgroup information is often a valid causal link to clinical state.



Multi-modality, High-dimensionality, “p )) n”

Healthcare data is often highly multimodal, extremely high-dimensional, and can have many more features than samples (e.g., genomics). Each of these aspects requires specialized methodological innovation.



Privacy

Healthcare data is extremely sensitive and is therefore protected by specialized laws such as HIPAA. A key goal of medical ML is therefore the development of algorithms that can verifiably preserve patient privacy with minimal tradeoffs in performance.





Submission Instructions:

Researchers interested in contributing should upload anonymized papers in PDF format by Mon, Sept 9, 2019, 11:59 PM in the timezone of your choice. At the time of submission, authors will indicate whether they would like the submission to 



1.) considered for inclusion in the official proceedings (up to 8 pages excluding references) or 



2.) considered as a non-archival extended abstract for presentation at the workshop only (up to 4 pages excluding references). Additional pages containing only bibliographic references can be included without penalty. 



A submission link and additional details regarding the two submission tracks will be provided on our website at least two weeks prior to the deadline: https://ml4health.github.io

 

Submissions should adhere to the NeurIPS conference paper format, via the NeurIPS LaTeX style file: https://nips.cc/Conferences/2019/PaperInformation/StyleFiles

Peer Review, Acceptance Criteria, & Registration/Attendance

All submissions will undergo double-blind peer review. It will be up to the authors to ensure the proper anonymization of their paper. Do not include any names or affiliations. Refer to your own past work in the third-person.



Accepted papers and extended abstracts will be chosen based on technical merit and suitability to the workshop's goals. All accepted works will be included in poster presentation sessions on the day of the workshop. Some accepted works will be invited to give short oral spotlight presentations at the workshop.



To promote community interaction, at least one presenting author should register for the workshop. Historically the main NeurIPS conference has sold out quickly, and this may extend to workshop registrations. If you plan to submit a paper, please register as soon as possible. Registration opens Sep. 6, 2019 (https://nips.cc/Register/view-registration), and registrations can be cancelled before November 28, 2019, 11:59 pacific time for a full refund (https://nips.cc/Help/CancellationPolicy). If you have already registered, confirm that you have a valid workshop registration.





Copyright for Accepted Papers:

Authors of accepted extended abstracts (non-archival submissions) retain full copyright of their work, and acceptance of such a submission to NeurIPS ML4H 2019 does not preclude publication of the same material in another journal or conference.



Papers aimed for proceedings should follow the general NeurIPS dual submission policies. Extended abstract submissions that are under review or have been recently published in a conference or a journal are allowed for submission. Authors should clearly state any overlapping published or submitted work at the time of submission. Authors should ensure that they are not violating any other venue dual submission policies.

COHDA was also held this past spring in Hiroshima and preceded the Golden Week period. Due to the inability of many participants to attend last April due to the peak season travel, we are holding COHDA this December again in Hiroshima.



In addition to the symposium, participants will have an opportunity to enjoy a free, guided tour in English of Hiroshima Peace Park, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.



The theme of COHDA 2017 is Challenges and Opportunities for Asia, which focuses on the issues of an increasingly globalized Asia that have resulted over the course of the past century. Asia has been a major site of colonialism and decolonization; global warfare; political upheaval and regime change; the rise of new nations; ongoing ethnic and religious conflict; economic boom and recession; population explosion; cultural diasporas; viral epidemics; technological advancement; and severe environmental pollution and disasters.



While commentators and analysts have rightly recognized the vast changes that have shaped the Asian continent, it is also crucial to understand the continuities that are maintained even in the face of such impetus for change. Apart from change, what are the constants that are still resistant to change? In addition, what are the factors that have contributed to such ongoing resilience? Although it may be argued that the forces of globalization and development have set in motion a number of positive changes in the ways we live our lives, this has also been counterbalanced by the continuities of inequality and suffering for many others. More than often, the tide of change exists in a state of tension with the forces of continuity. Hence, in order for us to comprehend the forces of change, we must also engage the other forces that hold it back.



We are offering a special early registration rate of only 23,500 JPY. We welcome submissions of 250 words in English by Friday, November 17, 2017.

In addition to the symposium, participants will have an opportunity to visit Hiroshima Peace Park and the famous shrine island of Miyajima — both are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.



HWB was first held in Hiroshima and we are delighted that so many of the speakers and participants from the inaugural symposium four years ago continue to return each year for this important event addressing the positive and negative impacts that globalization across Asia has brought into the health care industry.



While life expectancy across the board is increasing, traditional health metrics, such as infant mortality rate and infectious disease rate remain constant reminders of our need to be vigilant and address the sharp health care disparities underlying Asian nations as well as the diverse challenges they face.



How can we ensure the equitable and efficient allocation of health-related resources across all Asia to meet basic needs and emergencies?   What role can policy makers play in creating affordable universal health care?



With the theme Changing Priorities, it is hoped that today’s challenges in health care can be met with viable global solutions. Thus we welcome you to join us for this exciting 2-day symposium to share, learn and network as well as to explore the culture, history and beauty of Hiroshima!

It is becoming a global trend to work in the intersection between big data and analytics in healthcare. According to one estimate, 500 petabytes of digital healthcare data were generated in 2012 across the globe. By the year 2020, there will be 50 times increase. Simply having more data does not necessarily mean better healthcare outcome, unless the whole system from algorithms and software to storage and workflow can harness the data more efficiently, more effectively, and more timely. Rather than subjecting people to a battery of tests, or following a prescribed guidelines, the future of medicine will move to evidenced-based medicine. Treatment will be more personalized, forward looking (predictive) and preventive, proactive, and require less guess work.



This special session will focus on the latest research on the topics of healthcare modelling with a particular emphasis on big data technology that render the technological solution to be more accurate, more robust, and more efficient.



List of topics and the scope



We solicit papers that deal with the following aspects as illustrative examples and not necessarily exhaustive:



* Privacy preserving big data analytics for healthcare

* Personalized healthcare modelling

* Dealing with diverse, longitudinal healthcare data

* Data mining and machine learning for healthcare

* Ontology enhanced healthcare analytics

* Patient record clustering

* Translational healthcare

* Genomic and gene wide studies



The topic of big data fits SSCI and within this, the healthcare area has a great untapped potential due to the volume, variety, veracity, and velocity of data. More efficient, and more intelligent algorithms are certainly needed to better exploit the wealth of untapped information locked in patient records."

Scope



This conference is designed to bring together researchers, designers, developers and policy makers to exchange and share their experiences and efforts around designing and implementing digital healthcare technologies for the global south. Delivering healthcare services to sensitive/marginalized populations in the global south faces many challenges. Deficiencies in how the healthcare system operates and barriers patients face to get access to proper treatments pose a threat to the quality of care for these populations. In a situation where the use of digital technologies could potentially alleviate some of these issues, implementations in global south contexts have historically shown that foreign solutions are ineffective due to local constraints. When it comes to the use of digital systems and tools, the global south population still faces access, literacy, cultural and economic barriers preventing digital technologies to have a wider acceptance and market penetration.



DigiHealthSouth offers a common ground for academia and industry to share their novel works addressing global south’s healthcare scenarios. When it comes to the adaptation of technical systems for healthcare, there is a need for a deep understanding of the user and the stakeholders so the risk of failure is lessened. Therefore, we are interested in exchanging knowledge in the design of localized solutions where the user, his context and the local market are part of the design process. Efforts around eHealth, Telemedicine or Human Computer Interaction for Development (HCI4D) are welcome to discuss how these solutions have tackled remote healthcare delivery, chronic diseases, prevention and tailored cost-effective solutions.



The conference is scheduled for two days sessions, where each one will be opened by demo and/or poster demonstrations, followed by a keynote speaker opening the afternoon. Later, paper presentations will take place closing the sessions. For the first day, there will be a workshop hold by one of the sponsors. Breaks and social events will be spaces for sponsor organisations to exhibit their products and services.

This is particularly important in a lifelong learning culture: to engage and train workforce; discover and develop leaders; and support sharing of knowledge and experience.



By exploiting the latest simulation and visualization technologies, using serious games, we are now able to contextualize the player’s experience in stimulating realistic environments. Furthermore, a large and growing population is increasingly familiar with playing games, which makes them particularly suited as a powerful instructional tool. 



Serious games should lead to improved learning. We believe that providing evidence of such learning taking place is key to promote the adoption of serious games for education and training amongst healthcare practitioners. There is a growing need for information on in-situ game user assessment. Many are asking how to develop such games and how to apply such games. An effective application of Serious Games for training demands appropriate metrics, analytics, tools, and techniques for in-game user assessment. This can be achieved in particular by measuring elements such as learning outcomes and engagement, considering the twofold nature of Serious Games as compelling games that can also achieve precise learning outcomes. 



We believe that this scientific approach is necessary in order to develop a new generation of Serious Games that are able to meet the above mentioned expectations and requirements as more effective training tools.



We are seeking original contributions that advance the state of the art in the technologies and knowledge available to support development and deployment of serious games (SG). Experimental studies are strongly encouraged."

The utility further improves when social media is used in the areas like healthcare applications where socially integrated healthcare applications are getting familiarity. The integration of the healthcare application with social media provide ease of use, robustness, efficiency, reliability, resilience, and adaptability to the healthcare applications. Socially integrated mobile healthcare applications use wireless sensors to gather patient data, however this setup orients some vulnerabilities which can be categorized as: privacy, security and legal issues, and active and passive attacks. The attackers can cause much harm to the process by malicious attempts such as data modification, impersonation, eavesdropping and replaying. The primary purpose of these attacks is to steal the patient’s data, which is not only valuable but also private and sensitive. In some cases, implanted devices are used to administer drugs (such as insulin), and attacks could lead to serious outcomes for the patient if the administration of drugs is compromised. If the security issues with the healthcare applications are not resolved in a timely fashion, the impact may be catastrophic and may also cause the rise of socio-technical problems. 



This workshop proposal is focused to identify the advancements, gains, threats and weaknesses in socially integrated healthcare applications. Original contributions are sought in the following areas. The areas of interest include but not limited the following: 





Advancements in social integration of mobile healthcare applications 

Mobile decision support systems 

Vulnerabilities of socially integrated healthcare applications 

Security and privacy challenges in mobile information systems 

Healthcare application architecture in cloud environment 

Efficient data management for mobile healthcare management

With the growth of the internet and technologies, the data has become humongous even when it is originated from a single source. Hence, when the data is originated from various heterogeneous sources in a distributed global scenario the data processing gets more complicated due to the magnitude of data. The soft computing techniques and machine learning have become standard in providing promising solutions to the processing, prediction and visualizing the data received from the Internet of Things. Soft computing techniques can bring the opportunity of predicting any misfortune even before they happen.



Recently, meaningful development has been reported in the field of risk and behavioral monitoring. These achievements are mostly based on ICT techniques, such as body area networking, human-assisted rehabilitation, and remote diagnosis. However, risk and behavioral monitoring (for example, integrating health services) with the existent communication method and providing remote medical treatments with accuracy and precision is still a challenging task. To this end, the new soft computing based decision-making approaches that comprehend the research findings from the fuzzy and rough sets theory, neural networks, genetic algorithm, and artificial intelligence are actively developing. 



The aim of this special issue is to explore new technologies, methodologies, and applications that relate to all aspects of soft computing techniques with the focus on healthcare. Contributions may come from diverse fields engineering and healthcare, and the guest editors invite original and high-quality submissions addressing all aspects of this field, as long as the connection to the focus topic is clear and emphasized. 



TOPICS: 

Soft computing techniques for risk and behavioral management in healthcare

Signal processing and representing learning behavioral data

Fuzzy and rough sets theory for risk and behavioral monitoring

Real-time monitoring with big data processing and analytics for IoT in healthcare

Soft computing based multimedia technology for monitoring system with IoT

Ubiquitous sensing and intelligence in IoT based healthcare

High-performance computing for IoT applications in healthcare

Data Visualizations techniques for a ubiquitous environment in healthcare

Soft computing techniques for healthcare decision-support systems

Machine learning techniques for risk modelling and risk management



This special issue will be published in EAI Endorsed Transactions on Pervasive Health and Technology, an open access journal abstracted/indexed in Scopus, DOAJ, DBLP, CrossRef, EBSCO, WorldCat, Dimensions, among others. It focuses on personal electronic health assistants, health crowdsourcing, data mining and knowledge management, IT applications to needs of patients, disease prevention and awareness, electronic and mobile health platforms including design and more.

However, a big majority of such partnerships do not succeed and terminate with little or no benefits to either party. This conference will shed light on industrial engineering techniques and practices that may help organizations and universities in their quest to build successful university – industry alliances.



The 2nd GCHSEM is a highly anticipated conference due to the popularity of the field. The 2nd GCHSEM is set to become an exciting event with the potential for continued growth throughout the years. The 2nd GCHSEM will be a forum for academics, managers and solution providers, which brings together researchers and practitioners from all over the world, promoting opportunities to share experiences, debate ideas, identify tendencies, and introduce the latest developments in the largely multidisciplinary field of Healthcare Systems Engineering & Management. This is especially important since this field can largely benefit from increased collaboration. The 2nd GCHSEM will take place from July 14th to July 15th at the Elite World Istanbul Hotel in Istanbul, Turkey.



Istanbul is the only city in the world built on two continents. Its rich history has given it a multitude of museums, historical buildings and mosques, Byzantine churches and Roman aqueducts. This exciting venue is alive with the hustle and bustle of business and trade which for centuries has made it a vital trading hub between east and west. Straddling Europe and Asia, Istanbul is the largest and most monumental city in Turkey, and is a melting pot of cultures which mix harmoniously on both sides of a city split geographically by the Bosphorus strait. This bustling city is home to over 13 million people, and from 14 to 15 July 2016, will also be home to the 2nd GCHSEM."

Workshop for Gamification and Serious Games in Healthcare (WS-GSGHC)

https://docs.google.com/document/d/11_nbESkhFUAhnf_rszonNeHyyIcLPXAvNlGTdDB2oVA/edit



Dates 01-03 July 2013

Maribor, Slovenia

 

The demographic change and the graying society is a global challenge for many countries around the world. Increasing numbers of old and frail people, limited numbers of caregivers and exploding costs in the health care system require new and innovative approaches to support care-givers,  care-recipients, as well as families. It is of uttermost importance that novel approaches do not only address the seniors as passive care-recievers but conceptualize them as active parts of the caring situation, supporting care requirments and actively overtaking responsibility for maintaining own health. 



Using Serious Games and gamification proves a suitable tool to help people stay fit and healthy for longer, to support rehabilitation measures and to learn about illnesses, their prevention, their cure or successful strategies to cope with illnesses and maintain a quality of life. Still, games for health are not yet suitable for the mass market. It is not yet clear, how games for health can be made not only useful, but also enjoyable and fun and accepted by people of all genders, ages, education levels and technology experience.



The workshop is intended for researchers, industry and practitioners from various domains working in areas from healthcare to gerontology, who use or want to use serious games and gamification. Primary goal of the workshop is to present state-of-the-art research and to build and intensify a network of researchers and practitioners. Topics that can be discussed during the workshop range from new and innovative approaches for rehabilitation, motivation to prevent illnesses, using games for educating medical professionals, acceptance of games in healthcare and usability of these games.

 

The workshop is intended as a meeting-point for researchers and practitioners from different backgrounds and disciplines who work in the area of healthcare and apply methods from serious gaming and gamification. The workshop should bring together gerontologists, computer scientists, physicians, as well as psychologists, sociologists and ethicists to discuss the possibilities, limitations and consequences of games and gamification in healthcare.

 



Submissions:



Should be original and not submitted and/or published in other journals or conferences. There is a peer-review procedure intended, thus workshop committee members, external reviewers as well as potential authors will review the submissions. Papers selected by the Workshop Committee will be presented at the workshop and afterwards published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) Series.



 

Format:



Papers should be 8 to 12 pages long including all figures and references.

The format should be according to the LNCS format and submitted to the conference system as a single PDF file. Submissions must be fully anonymous, with no author names, affiliations acknowledgements, or obvious references. The submission should begin with a title, abstract and a list of key words.



 

Deadlines:



All paper should be submitted no later than January 18th 2013 via the SouthCHI conference website (Link: TBA).

Notification will be given no later than February 8th 2013.

We aim to gather the principal practitioners and their experiences under one roof to discuss their findings, incite collaboration and move the state of the art forward. We plan to position this forum as the premier venue for presenting and discussing work in progress in how to develop and maintain pervasive computing solutions in the Smart Health domain.

Smart healthcare emerges as a novel technology that aims to provide round-the-clock monitoring of several vital signs of patients using various health sensors, specialized communication protocols, and intelligent context-aware applications. Smart healthcare applications proactively contact the caregiver provided any abnormality arises in the health condition of a monitored patient. It has been a boon to the patients suffering from different diseases and requiring continuous monitoring and care, such as, disabled individuals, assisted living, children of different ages, and adults who are susceptible to near-fatal falls or sudden increases in blood pressure, heart rates, stress level, etc. Since there are heterogeneous devices and communication technologies introduced by different companies, major issues that need to be addressed are (1) A unified platform to facilitate coordination between the large-scale device distributions, (2) plug-and-play type inclusion of newer health sensors and replacing old ones without destabilizing the system, (3) Securing personal health records collected over multiple devices, and finally, (4) collecting, managing, storing and making decisions over several critical healthcare events composing various real-time data traces. Applying machine intelligence techniques by AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) researchers for intelligent and decentralized decision making in Healthcare should also be considered for the distributed Smart Health applications.

Special BHI-AMT 2013 Joint Keynote:

Yuichiro Anzai

President, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science



Keynote Speakers:



Shinsuke Shimojo, California Institute of Technology, USA

Brain and Health Informatics (BHI) aims to develop and disseminate

understandings of novel intelligent computing formalisms, techniques,

and technologies in the special application contexts of brain and

health/well-being related studies and services. It is devoted to

interdisciplinary studies on BHI, covering computational, logical,

cognitive, neuro-physiological, biological, physical, ecological, and

social perspectives of BHI.



BHI’13 aims to provide a leading international, interdisciplinary

forum to bring together researchers and practitioners that explore the

interplay between studies of human brain and health/well-being related

issues and advents of computer science and information

technologies. For instance, emerging advanced information

technologies, such as Internet/Web of things (IOT/WOT), the wisdom Web

of things (W2T), cloud computing, may be applied to brain

studies. Informatics-enabled brain studies, e.g., based on functional

magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG),

positron emission tomography (PET), and eye-tracking, can

significantly broaden the spectrum of theories and models of brain

sciences, which will in turn offer new insights into the development

of intelligent computing systems and informatics. BHI will feature

high-quality, original research papers in all theoretical,

technological, clinical, and interdisciplinary studies that make up

the field of brain/health informatics.



The systematic BHI methodology has resulted in the BHI big data,

including various raw brain data, data-related information, extracted

data features, found domain knowledge related to human intelligence,

and so forth. A brain data centre needs to be constructed on the W2T

and cloud computing platform for effectively utilizing the “data

wealth” as services, which provides big opportunities for both

fundamental and clinical researches with respect to cognitive science,

neuroscience, and mental health. The most challenging problem is to

curate BHI big data, which can be characterized by four parameters:

volume, variety, velocity, and value, in order to support data sharing

and reuse among different BHI experimental and computational studies

for generating and testing hypotheses about human and computational

intelligence.



BHI’13 will be jointly held with the International Conference on

Active Media Technology (AMT'13).

However, a big majority of such partnerships do not succeed and terminate with little or no benefits to either party. This conference will shed light on industrial engineering techniques and practices that may help organizations and universities in their quest to build successful university – industry alliances.



The 1st GCIE is a highly anticipated conference due to the popularity of the field. The 1st GCIE is set to become an exciting event with the potential for continued growth throughout the years. The 1st GCIE will be a forum for academics, managers and solution providers, which brings together researchers and practitioners from all over the world, promoting opportunities to share experiences, debate ideas, identify tendencies, and introduce the latest developments in the largely multidisciplinary field of Industrial Engineering. This is especially important since this field can largely benefit from increased collaboration. The 1st GCIE will take place from July 14th to July 15th at the Elite World Istanbul Hotel in Istanbul, Turkey.



Istanbul is the only city in the world built on two continents. Its rich history has given it a multitude of museums, historical buildings and mosques, Byzantine churches and Roman aqueducts. This exciting venue is alive with the hustle and bustle of business and trade which for centuries has made it a vital trading hub between east and west. Straddling Europe and Asia, Istanbul is the largest and most monumental city in Turkey, and is a melting pot of cultures which mix harmoniously on both sides of a city split geographically by the Bosphorus strait. This bustling city is home to over 13 million people, and from 14 to 15 July 2016, will also be home to the 1st GCIE."

There is an urgent need for, and evidence of, the application of domain-specific pervasive and ubiquitous techniques to support social and collaborative innovations to improve healthcare service delivery. By techniques here we mean not only the introduction of technologies (e.g. sensors), but also the computational algorithms to derive meaning from the data, the data management practices, and the organisational practice changes affected by methods aimed to make the delivery of healthcare more efficient and personalised through improved monitoring and computational organising of resources and staff.



The PUTHSDI workshop is the premier interdisciplinary forum for leading international healthcare delivery researchers, managers, clinicians, operations specialists, practitioners, industrial designers, and developers to present and discuss key issues and methods to do with the incorporation of ubiquitous and pervasive computing for healthcare service improvement. This includes the design, development, deployment, and impacts of ubiquitous and pervasive computing technologies to better understand how healthcare providers manage their time, task load, communication, and other factors in order to improve service delivery.



SCOPE & FOCUS



The workshop seeks two types of submissions: (1) short papers describing research and/or practice outcomes in relation to the use of pervasive/ubiquitous techniques for healthcare service improvement and (2) position papers describing new research/practice challenges and worthy topics to discuss in all areas of the application of pervasive/ubiquitous techniques for healthcare service improvement. Submissions may relate to nursing, clinical, mental health or other healthcare practice, and may crossover technology (hardware and/or software) considerations, human factors, or organisation factors.



Topics may include (but are not limited to):



- Consequences upon how tasks are assigned and performed, and/or public perception given ubiquitous access to information from hand held devices deployed in hospital wards

- Understanding impacts on hospital systems from changes to the navigational aids, owing to ubiquitous indoor positioning

- Changes to the usage of resources in hospitals owing to the electronic tagging of equipment, personnel, and patients

- Potential security attacks to healthcare provision owing to the introduction of pervasive computing systems such as wearable or handheld devices

- Access control for sharing data captured by ubiquitous sensors in hospitals and other healthcare contexts

- Understanding ethical and privacy concerns and expectations from staff and patients

- Staff testing of pervasive/ubiquitous technologies



We invite the submission of one contribution from any of these categories:

- A short paper (3-6 page inc. refs) that may cover research/practice results, or experience reports.

- Abstract summary (200-400 words) about work in progress, and/or novel tools, technologies, or methods that you use and would be appropriate for discussion during the workshop.

- A position statement (300 words – 2 pages) about a key pervasive/ubiquitous healthcare service delivery challenge or policy need that can be discussed during the workshop. These should present arguable opinions about an issue, and may include new ideas or discussions of topics at various stages of completion (including speculative).



All submissions should describe the purpose/goals of the work, cite related work if applicable, and clearly state whether the topic is refers to innovations, lessons learned, or both. In addition to your main submission, please also include a biographical statement that can be shared with the rest of the attendees if you are selected to attend.



Workshop submissions will be reviewed by the program committee for acceptance/participation. Accepted works and biographical statements will be made available to all workshop participants prior to the workshop in order to maximise the value of the workshop by fostering an exchange of critiques of one another’s activities beforehand. Furthermore, authors of accepted submissions will be invited to present their ideas/work at the workshop.



Submissions should be emailed to puthsdi15@gmail.com as a .pdf. Submissions greater than one page should use SIGCHI non-archival format (Word or LaTeX).

SCOPE

Healthcare systems in many countries are looking to leverage emerging technologies from cloud computing to mobile apps to data science to biosensors and wearable devices while ensuring continuous quality improvement in the presence of rapidly changing demographics and an increased demand for complex care. The development and implementation of software-intensive systems has been seen a key enabler for healthcare system reform and many jurisdictions have provided major investments and incentive programs to propel this transformation. At the same time, interoperability barriers continue to impede adoption, especially in the context of complex care where different types of healthcare providers from different organizations need to collaborate. This workshop will provide a forum where students, researchers, and practitioners from software engineering, health informatics, and medical domains to develop practices and promote suitable standards, methods, models and techniques, shaping the next generation of health information systems that also ensure safety, security and sound governance.



TOPICS

This workshop will focus on the combination of the following themes, but not limited to: methods and techniques for designing, developing, and evaluating eHealth, mHealth, telehealth, and electronic health records systems, software architectures, software product lines, reference architectures, technical debt, big biomedical data, software quality, user interfaces, systems interoperability, cloud native applications, safety, security, governance, workflow integration, system quality, compliance

and regulatory issues, data analytics, healthcare performance management, and continuous quality improvement. 

We look for papers that explore the above challenges (as well as other software engineering topics relevant to healthcare systems) and the role that software engineering plays in creating solutions to address them. We are expressly interested in applications from researchers in developing and underserved countries. We are also interested in submissions related to emerging trends in current practice submitted by those working in healthcare.

We believe that a third meeting like the one we are going to celebrate this year, reinforces the original idea of establishing a working network for discussion and exchange of scientific knowledge focused on the application of Monte Carlo method to radiotherapy practice.



From the first meeting in Ghent, Belgium in 2006, and after the last one in Cardiff in 2009, the role of Monte Carlo in radiotherapy planning has continued growing and becomes more relevant every day, as new techniques are more sophisticated and ambitious. IGRT and 4-D planning are facing new cumulative uncertainties which require accurate calculations to justify the additional workload involved.



This Workshop on MCTP of the European Workgroup (EWG-MCTP) is addressed to stimulate scientists information exchange, and to offer the opportunity to scientists to exchange information, and to generate international collaborations.

"1624355890-1371","http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=healthcare&page=11","ProHealth 2014","http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=37373&copyownerid=2","Healthcare organizations are facing the challenge of delivering high quality services to their patients at affordable costs. These challenges become more prominent with the growth in the aging population with chronic diseases and the rise of healthcare costs. High degree of specialization of medical disciplines, huge amounts of medical knowledge and patient data to be consulted in order to provide evidence-based recommendations, and the need for personalized healthcare are prevalent trends in this information-intensive domain. The emerging situation necessitates computer-based support of healthcare process & knowledge management as well as clinical decision-making.



BPM technology provides a key to implement these changes. Though patient-centered process support becomes increasingly crucial in healthcare, BPM technology has not yet been broadly used in healthcare environments. This workshop shall elaborate both the potential and the limitations of IT support for healthcare processes. It shall further provide a forum wherein challenges, paradigms, and tools for optimized process support in healthcare can be debated. We want to bring together researchers and practitioners from different communities (e.g., BPM, Information Systems, Medical Informatics, E-Health) who share an interest in both healthcare processes and BPM technologies.



The first six ProHealth Workshops were held in conjunction with the 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th, and 10th International Conferences on Business Process Management (BPM’07, BPM'08, BPM'09, BPM'2011, BPM'2012), and in conjunction with the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine conference (BPM'2013); the last two ProHealth workshops were unified with the Knowledge Representation for Healthcare workshop, in order to bring these communities of BPM and AI in medicine closer together. The great success of the past 6 workshops demonstrated the potential of such an interdisciplinary forum to improve the understanding of domain specific requirements, methods and theories, tools and techniques, and the gaps between IT support and healthcare processes that are yet to be closed. 



Workshop Theme



Enterprise-wide process-oriented information systems have been demanded by healthcare institutions for over 20 years and terms like “continuity of care” have even been discussed for over 50 years. Yet, healthcare organizations are currently using a plethora of specialized non-standard information systems and continue to focus on development of systems for specialized departments that frequently only focus on their internal processes. Many of the successful existing healthcare information systems are not process-oriented, but focus on specific functions like imaging, drug order-entry, laboratory test result storage, storage of diagnoses and progress notes in electronic medical records, alerts and reminders, and billing.



Information systems and decision-support systems for managing patient care processes, however, are still scarcely developed; and the latter is most often accomplished by only a small number of university-led teams. Such patient care management systems are highly complex and pose many challenges: they require availability of encoded data coming from different sources, flexibility in deviating from the encoded process at the discretion of the physician user, and may involve a team of clinical users that together take care of a patient in a coordinated way.



The recent trend towards healthcare networks and integrated care even increases the need to effectively support interdisciplinary cooperation along with the patient treatment process. Recent studies discussing the preventability of adverse events in medicine recommend the use of information technology, since insufficient communication and missing information turned out to be among the major factors contributing to adverse events. Yet, there is still a discrepancy between the potential and the actual usage of IT in healthcare.



This workshop focuses on research projects which aim at closing this gap. It shall elaborate both the potential and the limitations of IT support for healthcare processes, and discuss approaches existing in this context.



Relevant topics include but are not limited to:



•           Computer-interpretable clinical guidelines / protocols and decision support



•           Process modeling in healthcare



•           Workflow management in healthcare



•           Semantic integration of healthcare processes with electronic medical records



•           Knowledge representation and ontologies for healthcare processes



•           Facilitating knowledge-acquisition of healthcare processes



•           Visualization, monitoring and mining healthcare processes



•           Personalization and adaptation of healthcare processes



•           Compliance of healthcare processes



•           Evaluation of quality and safety of careflow systems



•           Managing flexibility and exceptions in healthcare processes



•           Process optimization and simulation in healthcare organizations and healthcare networks



•           Patient empowerment in healthcare processes



•           Lifecycle management for healthcare processes



•           Integrating healthcare processes with electronic medical records



•           Context-aware healthcare processes



•           Ambient intelligence & smart processes in healthcare



•           Mobile process support in healthcare



•           Process interoperability & standards in healthcare



•           Process-oriented system architectures in healthcare



Submitted papers will be evaluated on the basis of significance, originality, technical quality, and exposition. Papers should clearly establish their research contribution and the relation to healthcare processes."

Organizers:  Yngve Lamo, Bergen University  College, Norway;  Adrian Rutle, Aelsund University College, Norway; Wendy MacCaull, St. Francis Xavier University, Canada

 

Rising costs, ageing populations and increased expectations are making the current healthcare systems in the developed world unsustainable. Information technology has the potential to support healthcare but its application has not nearly reached its full potential. Barriers include the distributed and localized nature of the services; continuous changes due to updates in the rules and guidelines; the complexity of the information; and the plethora of requirements placed on the systems by a network of stakeholders. Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) is an emerging and promising methodology for software systems, targeting challenges in software engineering relating to productivity, flexibility and reliability. MDSE is especially useful as a methodology for the development of healthcare systems having the abovementioned barriers in mind. The construction of a metamodelling hierarchy is at the core of many MDSE techniques, especially when new tools and modelling languages are created for the domain-experts.

 

Submissions are invited dealing with MDSE in general and metamodelling in particular, focusing on their applicability to healthcare, and can range from theoretical aspects to more applied case studies or prototype systems targeting applications. Papers (max. 6 pages +2 pages for an additional fee) are requested to be submitted using ICTH (Procedia) template; papers will be refereed; those accepted will appear in the Procedia volume in a section devoted to MMHS. Please submit your paper using the Easychair submission system https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mmhs2014 . All papers accepted for workshops will be included in the ICTH-2014 proceedings, which will be published by Elsevier. The authors must follow Elsevier guidelines as given in ICTH-2014 Website. Extended versions of the selected outstanding papers presented at the workshops, after revision, will be considered for publication in journals special issues.

 



Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

----------------------------------------------------

	- theory and practice of metamodelling with application in healthcare

	- correctness of healthcare models and metamodels

The notion of the learning healthcare system has been put forward to denote the translation of routinely collected data into knowledge that drives the continual improvement of medical care by seamlessly embedding learned best practices in the healthcare delivery process. This notion has been described in many forms, but each follows a similar cycle of assembling, analyzing and interpreting data from multiple sources (clinical records, guidelines, patient-provided data including wearables, omic data, etc..), followed by feeding the acquired knowledge back into clinical practice. This framework aims to provide personalised recommendations and decision support tools to aid both patients and care providers, to improve outcomes and personalise care.

Research carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) reveals that almost 95 percent of medics practicing in less developed countries are reliant on medical technology that has been imported.



More than half of this technology, however, is not utilised as staff have insufficient means to maintain the equipment or insufficient knowledge to operate it. Subsequently, there is inadequate provision for administering healthcare in the developing world. Other problems include unreliable power and water supplies, inappropriate donations of equipment, consumables and pharmaceuticals, unsafe disposal of medical equipment and waste, political instability and war. The need is for appropriate, affordable, sustainable and quality equipment, supplies and support in both development and emergency situations.



The 7th IET International Conference provides delegates with a great opportunity to learn about the key issues surrounding healthcare provision in the developing world and to network with fellow workers.For detailed programme please visit: http://conferences.theiet.org/aht/programme/index.cfm



There will be a post-conference on-line debate on the electronic discussion forum INFRATECH. For those delegates and authors who have not already subscribed to INFRATECH, instructions on how to subscribe can be found on the INFRATECH website.



Note: all authors will be required to subscribe to INFRATECH before their papers can be accepted for presentation at the conference. Papers presented at the conference will be available on-line for a limited period after the conference in order to facilitate the on-line debate.



The IET (and the IEE before it) have been holding these  two-yearly events on appropriate healthcare technologies (AHT) since the year 2000. Archives on previous events and resources on AHT can be found on the Appropriate Healthcare Technologies for Developing Countries (AHT) community website.

HWB was also held this past summer in Hiroshima and preceded the 72nd Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony. Due to the inability of many participants to attend in August due to the memorial and peak season travel, we are holding HWB this December again in Hiroshima.



In addition to the symposium, participants will have an opportunity to enjoy a free, guided tour in English of Hiroshima Peace Park, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.



While life expectancy across the board is increasing, traditional health metrics, such as infant mortality rate and infectious disease rate remain constant reminders of our need to be vigilant and address the sharp health care disparities underlying Asian nations as well as the diverse challenges they face.



How can we ensure the equitable and efficient allocation of health-related resources across all Asia to meet basic needs and emergencies?   What role can policy makers play in creating affordable universal health care?



With the theme Facing New Challenges in Healthcare, it is hoped that today’s challenges in health care can be met with viable global solutions. Thus we welcome you to join us for this exciting symposium to share, learn and network as well as to explore the culture, history and beauty of Hiroshima!



We are offering a special early registration rate of only 23,500 JPY. We welcome submissions of 250 words in English by Friday, November 17, 2017. Click on the submission link below to submit your proposal today!

The workshop series aims to bring together clinical and AI researchers to foster collaborative discussions. This year, the workshop will be co-located with IJCAI 2019 in Macao, China and the focus is on learning healthcare systems.



The healthcare industry is undergoing significant transformation as organisations increasingly incorporate AI into important areas of healthcare delivery and management. The global market for AI in healthcare is estimated at 2.1bn USD in 2018, and is expected to be worth over 36bn USD by 2025. This success of AI is driven by the development of systems that are able to translate routinely collected data into knowledge that drives the continual improvement of medical care. Such systems have varying descriptions but each perform (a) data assembly, analysis and interpretation from multiple sources (clinical records, guidelines, patient-provided data including wearables, omic data, etc..); and improve clinical practice by automatically feeding acquired knowledge to clinician or patient-facing decision support systems to provide personalised recommendations , in the ultimate aims of improving outcomes and personalising care.



In this workshop we wish to address the challenge of leveraging knowledge-based models that can utilise patient-focused data to improve care delivery to bring about ""learning healthcare systems"". This calls for methods that can: 1) extract, organise and assemble from large amounts of structured and unstructured data silos, 2) analyse and discover actionable knowledge from the large, temporal and uncertainty-ridden healthcare data and 3) design tools to support clinical decision making and self-management by patients in an autonomous and efficient manner, and without jeopardising existing clinical workflows or the privacy of patient data. Therefore, the notion of the learning healthcare system encompasses research in prominent areas of Artificial Intelligence including language engineering, data mining, knowledge representation & reasoning, learning and autonomous systems.



This year we feature the KDH challenge, Multi-modal Low-back Pain Exercise Recognition:



- to provide AI researchers with an impactful case study and data with the potential to improve the health and wellbeing of people with low-back pain.



- to create a platform for AI researchers to compare the efficacy of different machine learning prediction approaches on a standard set of multi-modal sensor data."

Imagine if our health status can be constantly monitored whilst

doing our daily routine, imagine if we can be alerted of a subtle

abnormality with our heart while we asleep, and imagine if we can

be advised of a potential life-threatening disease without the

need to see a physician, and finally imagine if all of these had

already been possible, how many lives could have been saved. These

are not myths ? in fact with the advent of pervasive computing and

ambient intelligence, the notion of ""anytime"" and ""anywhere""

healthcare/medicine monitoring and management, which is coined as

Pervasive Healthcare, can be realized anytime sooner. Pervasive

Healthcare is predominantly supported by miniaturized mobile or

embedded information and communication technologies with some

degree of ""intelligence"" and advanced user interfaces.



Pervasive Healthcare is at the forefront of research, and presents

the ways in which mobile, sensor, embedded and wireless technologies

can be used to deliver the potential of pervasive healthcare.  This

potential includes prevention, abnormalities detections, short-term

monitoring (home healthcare monitoring), long-term monitoring (nursing

home), personalized healthcare monitoring, mobile health monitoring,

remote monitoring and diagnosis, fall-detection and management,

assisted applications, drugs transportation and treatment, to name a few.



In achieving this potential, it is imperative to consider the systems,

applications, algorithms, logical models, solution architectures and the

associated devices and communications technology. Importantly, this

attempt comes with issues, requirements, and challenges that must be

addressed in order to orchestrate various technological advanced devices

and drive them to work intelligently and seamlessly together to eventually

make systems and services that help majority of the world?s population.



There are two key perspectives of Pervasive Healthcare, one being the

domain of application of enabling technologies and the other being the

concept that integrates healthcare more seamlessly to our everyday life.

Pervasive Healthcare will essentially lead to a radical change from doctor

centric to patient centric models.



The objective of this symposium is to bring a high-level international

forum for academics, engineers, scientists, researchers and research scholars

to address the challenges and discuss opportunities to explore new research

directions and develop new ideas by soliciting work in progress and completed

research papers covering the state of the art in pervasive computing, systems,

services, applications, technologies and intelligence for healthcare. The topics

of interest include but are not limited to the following:

Aims and objectives 

=================================================== 



We are inviting submissions for a special issue of the Journal of Biomedical Informatics devoted to the topic of community-driven curation of ontologies and knowledge bases in Health Care and Life Sciences. The use of formal systems to define biomedical concepts and to represent and store biomedical knowledge has never been more important. In the past decade, ontologies have become central to the construction of intelligent decision-support systems, simulation systems, information-retrieval systems, and natural language systems. With the adoption of ontologies, especially by the broad biomedical community, the further development of ontologies and knowledge bases evolved into a community-driven process. This resulted in an increased number of knowledge bases published openly on the Web. Ontologies and knowledge bases are now authored/curated by more domain and knowledge experts than ever before. To ensure a high quality of the community-generated content, a well-defined cura! 

 tion process has to become a prominent and integral part of the life cycle of biomedical knowledge artifacts. 



Several large biomedical projects are trying to apply the ""wisdom of the crowds"" model for building and curating their knowledge content. This model is already familiar to most experts (c.f. Web 2.0) and has already been proven successful in large community projects in other domains. The emergence of different types of collaborative environments, such as, Wikis, content management systems, and collaborative ontology editors, enables novel ways of curating knowledge, hence transforming the workflow from being curator-centered to being community-driven. Such systems provide the means for communities of experts in different fields to collaboratively create, share and re-use knowledge. Their goal is to foster long term expansion and maximization of knowledge curation, extraction and reasoning, by creating live knowledge bases within their specific domains. 



The collaborative aspect of curation raises a series of challenges ranging from specific initial design decisions to capturing and maintaining temporal and change elements of the knowledge content. The aim of this issue is to build upon and complement the research detailed in the Special Issue on Ontologies for Clinical and Translational Research (Vol. 44, Issue 1, 2011) by focusing on collaboration, its associated challenges and emerging methods for knowledge and ontology curation. The use of ontologies, as shared conceptualizations of a domain, has proved to provide support in diverse areas of biomedical informatics, such as the development of databases or biosample repositories. This issue intends to take a step back and analyze the foundational aspect of achieving and maintaining the shared (community-driven) agreement of the conceptualization (and of the resulting knowledge bases) by scrutinizing a series of intrinsic issues like design patterns, consistency or emerging! 

  knowledge discovery. 



The issue is seeking, in particular, original methodological research papers, but will also consider survey papers, meant to provide a clear overview of the current state of the art in its specific themes of interest. Applications or system descriptions will be considered only as providing a context or use case for a detailed methodology, and not as individual (stand-alone) submissions. The topics of interest for the issue can be grouped into three main categories: 



1. Challenges and experiences emerging from the collaborative aspects of knowledge capture in HealthCare and Life Sciences, including: 

* design patterns 

* workflows for knowledge capture or refinement 

* managing change or revision of knowledge 

* managing inconsistent knowledge 

* hypotheses Ð representation, evaluation and validation 

* using linked data to support knowledge capture 

* user experience 



2. Innovative methods for collaborative knowledge management, including: 

* knowledge representation and reasoning 

* knowledge discovery 

* knowledge revision 

* hypotheses management 

* use of statistics in decision support systems 

* intelligent knowledge-based retrieval 

* knowledge integration from external sources 



3. Evaluation methods and metrics for: 

* the quality of the resulting curated knowledge 

* collaborative knowledge acquisition 

* collaborative knowledge discovery 

* intelligent knowledge-based retrieval

Guest Editors: 

Abe Zeid, Sagar Kamarthi and Vinod Sahney, Northeastern University, USA

 

Delivery of operationally and economically efficient healthcare is becoming one of the national priorities of the United States. Healthcare experts universally agree that focus on individuals and participation of individuals in their own care is important to transform healthcare systems from reactive to preventative, from clinic-centric to patient-centric, and from disease-centred to wellness-centred.

 

The much-talked about smart health and wellbeing programmes promote safe, effective, efficient, equitable and patient-centred health and wellness services through research and innovation. Patient-centric healthcare requires the creation of baseline data for each and every individual separately. Application of population-based specifications to a specific individual may lead to wrong diagnosis and treatment, particularly when the individual differs from the population due to various factors such as genetics, environment, socioeconomic conditions and medical history.

 

The Institute of Medicine, the National Academy of Engineering, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Science Foundation have been strongly advocating the application of industrial and systems engineering tools to improve the healthcare delivery system. The application of industrial and systems engineering principles and tools to model, analyse, optimise and design patient-centric healthcare delivery systems, including services for diagnosis, treatment and care, can bring significant and lasting improvements to the United States healthcare system and the quality of life across the population.

 

This special issue will focus on research issues that support patient-centric healthcare delivery systems that are modular, dynamically configurable, distributed, responsive, expansive, flexible and resilient. The issue seeks research contributions that address computational, algorithmic and systemic issues related to patient-centric healthcare delivery. Research contributions from diverse communities including industrial engineering, systems engineering, management science and health services are welcome.

These solutions aim to find new ways to obtain a better integration of the information technology in everyday life devices and activities.



AmI environments are integrated by several autonomous computational devices of modern life ranging from consumer electronics to mobile phones. Ideally, people in an AmI environment will not notice these devices, but they will benefit from the services these solutions provide them. Such devices are aware of the people present in those environments by reacting to their gestures, actions and context. Recently the interest in AmI environments has grown considerably due to new challenges posed by society, demanding highly innovative services, such as vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), e-Health, Internet of Things and Home Automation among others. The main focus of this edition of the UCAmI Conference will be ""Ambient Intelligence: Sensing, Processing and Using Environmental Information"".



Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) proposes solutions based on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to enhance the quality of life of elderly people. AAL promotes the provision of infrastructures and services for the independent or more autonomous living, via the seamless integration of info-communication technologies within homes and residences, thus increasing their quality of life and autonomy and reducing the need for being institutionalized or aiding it when it happens. This edition of IWAAL Conference focuses on ""Development and testing of ICT-based solutions in real life situations which enable and support sustainable care models for older adults"".



One natural and critical human need, where Ambient Intelligence can be used, is healthcare. In such a domain, ubiquitous systems can be used to improve quality of life of the people. While Ambient Intelligence in health applications is increasingly getting research momentum, it does not reach a level of maturity yet. Reasons for such deficiency include not only the challenges of understanding the health domain by computer scientists, but also the difficulty of dealing with a critical domain, where errors are unacceptable. This first edition of the AmIHEALTH is aimed at boosting this area of research by focusing not just on innovations on the infrastructure and technology required for achieving the ambient intelligence in health, such as smart environments and wearable medical devices, but also on the development of novel testing, verification and evaluation techniques that make possible the actual implementation of such innovations.

The workshop series aims to bring together clinical and AI researchers to foster collaborative discussions. This year, the workshop will be co-located with IJCAI 2019 in Macao, China and the focus is on learning healthcare systems.



The healthcare industry is undergoing significant transformation as organisations increasingly incorporate AI into important areas of healthcare delivery and management. The global market for AI in healthcare is estimated at 2.1bn USD in 2018, and is expected to be worth over 36bn USD by 2025. This success of AI is driven by the development of systems that are able to translate routinely collected data into knowledge that drives the continual improvement of medical care. Such systems have varying descriptions but each perform (a) data assembly, analysis and interpretation from multiple sources (clinical records, guidelines, patient-provided data including wearables, omic data, etc..); and improve clinical practice by automatically feeding acquired knowledge to clinician or patient-facing decision support systems to provide personalised recommendations , in the ultimate aims of improving outcomes and personalising care.



In this workshop we wish to address the challenge of leveraging knowledge-based models that can utilise patient-focused data to improve care delivery to bring about ""learning healthcare systems"". This calls for methods that can: 1) extract, organise and assemble from large amounts of structured and unstructured data silos, 2) analyse and discover actionable knowledge from the large, temporal and uncertainty-ridden healthcare data and 3) design tools to support clinical decision making and self-management by patients in an autonomous and efficient manner, and without jeopardising existing clinical workflows or the privacy of patient data. Therefore, the notion of the learning healthcare system encompasses research in prominent areas of Artificial Intelligence including language engineering, data mining, knowledge representation & reasoning, learning and autonomous systems.



This year we feature the KDH challenge, Multi-modal Low-back Pain Exercise Recognition:



- to provide AI researchers with an impactful case study and data with the potential to improve the health and wellbeing of people with low-back pain.



- to create a platform for AI researchers to compare the efficacy of different machine learning prediction approaches on a standard set of multi-modal sensor data."

Workplaces in behavioral healthcare are on the cusp of a massive transformation. Clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, social workers, and clinicians from adjacent disciplines will soon develop symbiotic relationships with machines that levage ubiquitous computing and cyberspace to make work more effective, efficient, and rewarding. The future of work in behavioral healthcare will not be constrained by subjective data from patients and the clinician’s unreliable intuition. Rather, the future of work in behavioral healthcare will emphasize intelligent tools, objective data, and actuarial decisions while allowing clinicians to focus on strengths rooted in their humanity: expressing compassion, building hope, and praising growth and development. In the year 2020, however, the vast majority of stakeholders in behavioral healthcare is unaware of this approaching transformation. Current training programs and treatment delivery infrastructures are not preparing clinicians to take advantage of emerging technologies and procedures that have profited other industries.



This workshop will bring together technologists and stakeholders within various domains of behavioral healthcare. Discussions will include how to identify areas of need, how to forge new collaborations, and how to partner with clinicians to embrace the rise of technologies while navigating risks. To capture the scope of the future of work in behavioral healthcare, organizers will solicit position papers of diverse content with respect to clinical disciplines, patient populations, diagnoses, assessments, and interventions.

Background and Motivation:



Like all industries, behavioral healthcare is on the cusp of transformation marked by workers forming symbiotic relationships with emerging technologies. The transformation will be motivated by the need for healthcare to be more effective and efficient. Costs in behavioral healthcare are tremendous and access to evidence-based treatment is highly restrictive. Government agencies and local communities are interested in ensuring that all people benefit from advances in behavioral healthcare. Technological innovations can address these needs while simultaneously ensuring the future of work in behavioral health becomes more rewarding; that is, to enhance the working experience rather than diminish it.



Despite anticipated benefits of new technologies, neither clinicians nor their institutions are prepared for the transformation. The time is now to build communities interested in the future of work in behavioral healthcare. These communities should involve contributions and feedback from all stakeholders, as each perspective is needed to see and fully appreciate the horizon of future work.



This workshop aims to build a community by casting a wide net of subject matter, which may help identify universal ideas and concerns regarding the future of work in behavioral healthcare. Anticipated questions include:

- What kind of training is required by clinicians to adopt innovations? And who will provide this training?

- What kind of mindset shift does there need to be from a provider perspective? And how will issues of compliance be addressed?

- What do technologists need to learn to make innovations acceptable to clinicians?

- How can technologists communicate with those in most need of advances to the workplace such as those with few resources yet great capacity demands?

- What skills to clinicians possess that can facilitate the work of technologists?



***



Objectives:



Sharing current innovative ideas and projects that are intended to improve aspects of work in behavioral healthcare.

Understanding how clinicians and technologists can collaborate and share complementary skills and perspectives to improve work in behavioral healthcare.

Predicting the benefits and risks of emerging innovations for work in behavioral healthcare.

Identifying priorities for new research directions for the future of work in behavioral healthcare.

Building a community around the future of work in behavioral healthcare.

Disseminating workshop contributions in a special section of an EAI-affiliated journal (details to be determined during workshop).

Yet recent reviews of the electronic health record (EHR) literature show that all is not well especially with respect to the alignment of organizational design and the engineered artifact.



Niazkhani et al (2009, p. 546) concluded ""When put in practice, the formal, predefined, stepwise, and role-based models of workflow underlying CPOE systems may show a fragile compatibility with the contingent, pragmatic, and co-constructive nature of workflow.” Two of the findings of Greenhalgh et al (2009, p. 767) were “While secondary work (audit, research, billing) may be made more efficient by the EPR, primary clinical work is often made less efficient” and “The EPR may support, but will not drive, changes in the social order of the workplace”. In addition, Fontaine et al (2010) concluded from a systematic literature review in primary care that “The potential for HIE to reduce costs and improve the quality of healthcare in ambulatory primary care practices is well recognized but needs further empiric substantiation.”



Organisational design and engineering (ODE) takes the position that the “either-or” mindset must be replaced with an integrated and more holistic view of designing the organisation and artifact. The complex interplay between organisation and engineering, often intangible, requires a multi-disciplinary approach to solve the challenge of the social and technological world of healthcare being inextricably linked to healthcare policy.



This special issue seeks contributions from the spectrum of disciplines that are involved directly in HCIT or broader healthcare fields that implicitly rely on HCIT (e.g., policies for care coordination). These contributions must have both the elements of organisational design and an engineered artifact regardless of research discipline. These might address theoretical, empirical and design-based studies on medical- technical infrastructures, tools and applications, health information behaviour, or cost/benefits, policy, as well as social implications. HCITs are broadly defined to include technologies in clinical informatics, e-health, m-health, consumer health, public health, and health policy.

Special Issue: Dental Informatics



Dental Informatics aims at improving the entire field of dentistry by providing a set of tools, methods and resources, which can transform and improve daily clinical practice as well as dental research and education by the aid of modern Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). For these reasons the knowledge it imparts must be considered essential and therefore should be mastered and taught. 

The aim of this Special Issue is to collect evidence-based information about research work, on-going projects and clinical experiences with Dental Informatics. The goal is twofold: on one hand, it will provide an updated state-of-the-art of the field and new research advances on some of the most topical aspects of this variegated and multidisciplinary field. On the other hand, this information can support clinical professionals in assessing how they can improve their daily practice, and can assist educators in the dentistry field in  providing their students with the skills increasingly needed in 21st century. We solicit original research articles, review articles and clinical studies.

Scope



PervasiveHealth is a premier international forum with specific focus on technologies and human factors related to the use of ubiquitous computing in healthcare and for wellbeing. The overall goal of the PervasiveHealth conference is to take a multidisciplinary approach to Pervasive Healthcare Technology research and development. The Pervasive Healthcare Community is addressing a broad scope of research topics and concerns: identify and understand problems from a technological, social, medical, and legal as well as financial perspective (with a particular emphasis on understanding and supporting patients’ and practitioners’ needs); design, implementation, and evaluation of supporting hardware and software infrastructures, algorithms, services and applications; and organizational strategies that facilitate integration of Pervasive Healthcare Technology into the healthcare enterprise.



Traditional healthcare environments are extremely complex and challenging to manage, as they are required to cope with an assortment of patient conditions under various circumstances with a number of resource constraints. Pervasive healthcare technologies seek to respond to a variety of these pressures by successfully integrating them within existing healthcare environments. Technologies, standards and procedures on their own provide little and or no meaningful service. It is essential that pervasive healthcare environments, through a combined approach of data collection, data correlation and data presentation, assist healthcare professionals in delivering high levels of patient care, and empower individuals and their families for self-care and health management.



PervasiveHealth aims to gather technology experts, practitioners, industry and international authorities contributing towards the assessment, development and deployment of pervasive medical based technologies, standards and procedures.



Pervasive Health 2020 invites Full-length Paper submissions, Posters proposals, Workshop Paper submissions, Workshop proposals and Doctoral Consortium submissions.

Summary:

----------

Continuous improvement of cost-effective healthcare and patient treatment is by far the top national interest worldwide. The proliferation, versatility, and agility of medical devices have revolutionized healthcare and contributed to the new era of internet of medical things (IoMT). Broadly speaking, these medical devices can range from heavy equipment for patient treatment in medical facilitates, to robotic and electro-mechanical artificial organs, to miniaturized medical sensors, and finally implantable medical devices. Energy efficiency of such medical devices has enormous benefits, not only to provide cost-effective healthcare, but also to improve patient care quality through continuous availability and robust measurements, which are key for the treatment of chronic diseases, and emergency situations. Diverse characteristics of medical devices pose many challenges to provide energy-efficient healthcare systems, which in many cases, requires multidisciplinary approaches to provide comprehensive solutions.

Energy and Mobility Services 

The energy sector continues to undergo substantial structural changes. Currently the expanding usage of renewable energy sources, the decentralization of energy supply and the market penetration of electric road vehicles have a significant impact on the future development of energy service requirements. In the transport sector, especially in road transport and intralogistics, the understanding of energy consumption and the efficient usage of energy in material handling technology is of increasing importance. In order to actively integrate consumers into the energy system of the future, appropriate incentives (e.g. electricity tariffs), market schemes, and service level concepts need to be developed and introduced. This requires among others new products in electricity retail markets, innovative marketing and comprehensive acceptance research and the investigation of future business models. Furthermore, efficient usage of energy, efficiency in costs and flexibility in mobility and reconfigurability have to be combined to create successful future mobility services, e.g. in logistics. This pillar therefore seeks contributions enhancing the understanding of the future role of services in energy economics, and e-mobility and logistics. Moreover, presentations and papers addressing the appropriate use of decision support methods in different phases of 

service innovation and marketing in these domains are welcome. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to: 

• Service innovation and marketing in energy economics and e-mobility 

• Service level engineering in electricity retail markets 

• Services for mobility 2.0 

• Mobility services in logistics 

• The role of smart grids and smart markets to foster demand-side flexibility 

• Acceptance of new tariffs (e.g., dynamic pricing) or new technologies (e.g., e-mobility) 

• Evaluation of business models in energy and mobility markets 



Healthcare Services, Logistics and Information Systems 

Demographic changes cause higher patient demands alongside severe cost pressure and 

increasing quality requirements. Therefore, more efficient healthcare services and logistics are desirable. Even though underlying planning problems in the area of Operations Research resemble the ones from other service or manufacturing industries (e.g., scheduling of different tasks, processes or appointments) healthcare services are especially challenging, because patients need different care than, for example, parts of cars. In addition, particularly interdisciplinary approaches are necessary for research on and improvement of healthcare services. Since Information Systems have high potentials for improving efficiency, they play an important role. Relevant topics or case studies include, but are not limited to: 

• Operations Research for Healthcare Services 

• Healthcare Service Networks 

• Appointment Planning 

• Ambulance Planning / EMS Planning 

• Home Healthcare Planning 

• Hospital Logistics 

• Hospital Information Systems 

• Telemedicine Systems 



Social Collaboration meets Service Innovation 

Collaborative approaches are playing an increasingly important role for individuals as well as corporations in tackling innovation endeavours. Today a variety of platforms that facilitate the multi-faceted process exist. They employ approaches contributing to the generation, conceptualization, evaluation, funding, and implementation of ideas and knowledge artefacts. However, there is a lack of interdisciplinary and mixed method approaches for disentangling and understanding the social, cognitive and collaborative processes that underpin these platforms. 

This workshop aims to juxtapose the social collaboration and service innovation communities with the intent to shed light on the foundational crowd aspects of social collaboration in service innovation and vice versa. Relevant topics or case studies include, but are not limited to: 

• Crowd management 

• Participation incentives as well as roles and responsibilities 

• Notions of quality and assessment 

• Analyzing social interaction in the collaboration process 

• Facilitator and participant behaviors 

• Social discourse and social network structures 

• Service models for crowd facilitation 

• Representation and ascription of competence 

• Boundaries and limitations of crowds 



Semantic Web Technologies, Web Services and Data Analytics 

Traditional Web services based on WSDL and SOAP have dominated the world of services on the Web for a long time. Inspired by the Semantic Web community and aiming to provide a higher level of task automation through semantics, researchers focused on bridging the gap between services and semantics. However, with the proliferation of Web APIs the solutions devised in the context of traditional Web services are unsuitable for addressing the challenges faced by resource-oriented APIs, commonly called REST or RESTful services. Still, up to date, a number of challenges related to using Web services, and especially the support for APIs as well as the facilitating of their integration with data on the Web, remain unaddressed. Relevant topics or case studies include, but are not limited to: 

• Frameworks, methods, models and formats for describing Web services and Web APIs 

• Identifying the essential building blocks for enabling integrated use of Web services and Web APIs 

• Development of intelligent and generic clients 

• Use cases, applications, surveys on Web services and Web APIs 

• Capturing added value through the use of Web APIs, Web resources and development of client applications"

Medical information is rapidly becoming digital. In the United States, the government is providing incentives for doctors to transition to electronic medical records. Tools such as Google Health and Microsoft HealthVault are giving individual patients the ability to manage their own health data. Medical devices and home-care coordination are driving an increase in digital health data sources, while the genomic revolution, with full sequencing achievable for a few thousand dollars and only minutes of processing, is providing a deluge of data we barely know how to manage. The focus of this workshop, HealthSec, is the exploration of security and privacy issues that arise from this exploding quantity of digital personal health information, in both the provider and the patient settings.



HealthSec is intended as a forum for lively discussion of aggressively innovative and potentially disruptive ideas on all aspects of medical and health security and privacy. We strongly encourage cross-disciplinary interactions between fields, including, but not limited to, technology, medicine, and policy. Surprising results and thought-provoking ideas will be strongly favored; complete papers with polished results in well-explored research areas are comparatively discouraged. We will select position papers that show potential to stimulate or catalyze further research and explorations of new directions, as well as extended abstracts that explore a specific issue a little more deeply, including preliminary results.



The workshop will combine posters and brief presentations by position paper authors, slightly longer talks by extended abstract authors, and panel discussions around 2 or 3 major topic areas. We expect the workshop to be highly interactive. There will be no published proceedings, but authors of accepted position papers and extended abstracts will be expected to make their papers available on their own Web sites before the workshop.



Topics

Workshop topics include all areas related to healthcare security and privacy, including:

Security and privacy models for healthcare information systems

Industry experience in securing healthcare information systems

Design and deployment of patient-oriented systems for securely accessing and managing personal health data

Security and privacy threats against existing and future medical devices—and countermeasures

Regulatory and policy issues of healthcare information systems

Privacy of medical information

Usability issues, especially combined with security constraints

Threat models for healthcare information systems

Please contact the program co-chairs if you have any questions.



Submissions

Submitted position papers must be no longer than two 8.5"" x 11"" pages. Submitted extended abstracts should be no longer than four 8.5"" x 11"" pages. All papers should be typeset in two-column format in 10 point type on 12 point (single-spaced) leading, with a text block no more than 6.5"" wide by 9"" deep. Submissions are single-blind; authors should include their names and affiliations as part of their submissions. Submissions must be in PDF format and must be submitted via the Web submission form.

Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. Accepted submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication on the authors' Web sites; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.

Similar to last year, ML4H 2020 will both accept papers for a formal proceedings and accept traditional, non-archival extended abstract submissions. Authors are invited to submit works for either track provided the work fits within the purview of Machine Learning for Health. In addition, we especially solicit works that speak to this year’s ML4H theme: Advancing Healthcare for All. 



We are also piloting mentorship programs for authors and reviewers. See https://ml4health.github.io/pages/mentorship.html for additional details.



===== Important Dates =====

- Monday, Sep. 28: Submission Title/Summary Paragraph Deadline

- Friday, Oct. 2: Submission Deadline

- Friday, Oct. 16: Reviews Due 

- Tuesday, Oct. 20: Limited Author Response Deadline

- Wednesday, Oct. 28th: Final Decisions Released

- Friday or Saturday, Dec 11-12, 2020: Virtual Workshop



===== Theme & Topics =====

We invite submissions from all areas of machine learning for health and biomedicine but we especially encourage submissions that focus on this year’s theme, Advancing Healthcare for All.



The application of machine learning to healthcare is often characterised by the development of cutting-edge technology aiming to improve patient outcomes. By developing sophisticated models on high-quality datasets we hope to better diagnose, forecast, and otherwise characterise the health of individuals. At the same time, when we build tools which aim to assist highly-specialised caregivers, we limit the benefit of machine learning to only those who can access such care. The fragility of healthcare access both globally and locally prompts us to ask, “How can machine learning be used to help enable healthcare for all?” 



To this end, we will actively encourage the submission and presentation of new work which explores any of the following topics:

- Accessible diagnostic and prognostic systems

- Health equity

- Fairness and bias in machine learning systems

- Generalisation across populations or systems

- Improving patient participation in health

- Augmenting and supporting the capabilities of healthcare workers

- Rare or underserved diseases

- Democratising ML4H research

- Non-traditional delivery of healthcare



===== Awards =====

For the first time, thanks to sponsorship from Roche, ML4H will grant awards to exceptional papers and reviewers. In particular, at this time we plan to feature the following awards:

- Best Newcomer Submission: This award will honor the best submission from either track with a first author who has not had prior work accepted to the workshop before.

- Best Thematic Submission: This award will honor the best submission from either track that is aligned with this year’s theme: Advancing Healthcare for All.

- Top Reviewer Award: This award will honor the top reviewers.



Awardees will be recognized at the event directly, and more prizes may be announced at a later date. Check back in later to learn more details!



===== Mentorship Opportunities =====

This year, ML4H will also be piloting mentorship programs for authors and reviewers. We especially encourage less experienced authors and reviewers and participants from underrepresented backgrounds to sign up as mentees, as well as more senior community members to serve as mentors for these programs.



For more details, see here: https://ml4health.github.io/2020/pages/mentorship.html



===== Submission Tracks =====

Like last year, ML4H 2020 will feature two submission tracks: a full, archival proceedings track and a non-archival, extended abstract track. Submissions to either track will undergo double-blind peer review. It will be up to the authors to ensure the proper anonymization of their papers. Do not include any names or affiliations. Refer to your own past work in the third-person. Malformed, non-blinded, non-healthcare oriented, or grossly insufficient works may be desk rejected without undergoing additional review. In addition, submissions to both tracks will be featured at the workshop’s virtual poster session, and a subset of works (from either track) will be invited to give a spotlight presentation about their work.



Accepted papers and extended abstracts will both be chosen based on technical merit and suitability to the workshop's goals. More details on how to write an excellent ML4H paper or extended abstract can be found here: https://ml4health.github.io/2020/pages/writing-guidelines.html



We strongly encourage examining this document, as they will also be used to communicate to reviewers what features of submissions are most important to this venue. Below are the salient differences between both tracks.



=== Proceedings Track ===

Full proceedings papers can be up to 8 pages (excluding references). Excellent ML4H Proceedings papers should be compelling, cohesive works with a high degree of technical sophistication as well as clear and high-impact relevance to healthcare. 

Papers that are submitted to the ML4H proceedings track should follow the general NeurIPS dual submission policies, and most notably cannot be already published or under review in any other archival venue. Similarly, papers published to the ML4H proceedings cannot be published again later at any other venue.



=== Extended Abstract Track ===

Non-archival extended abstracts can be up to 4 pages (excluding references), though additional information not critical for understanding the work can be included in an appendix without penalty (reviewers will review the work based predominantly on the main text). 

An excellent extended abstract is one that leads to insight at the workshop through interaction with other attendees. This can be through presenting new ideas/ways of thinking, leading to insightful discussion and feedback, dissemination new valuable resources, or enabling new opportunities for collaborations. We also especially solicit “non-traditional research artifacts” as submissions to the extended abstract track, such as papers highlighting novel datasets, insightful negative results, exciting preliminary results that warrant rapid dissemination, reproducibility studies, and opinion pieces or critiques. Authors of accepted extended abstracts (non-archival submissions) retain full copyright of their work, and acceptance of such a submission to NeurIPS ML4H 2020 does not preclude publication of the same material in another journal or conference. Furthermore, extended abstract submissions that are under review or have been recently published in a conference or a journal are allowed for submission. Authors should clearly state any overlapping published or submitted work at the time of submission, and must ensure that they are not violating any other venue dual submission policies.



===== Submission Instructions =====

Researchers interested in contributing will need to first submit their submission title and abstract (simply a short summary paragraph for extended abstract submissions, not the full submission) by Monday, Sep. 28, 2020, 11:59 PM anywhere on earth (AoE). Submission metadata may undergo minor modifications during final submission, but submitting a title/abstract is required for a full submission to be considered. Full submissions will be due on Fri, Oct 2, 2020, 11:59 PM AoE, and will be in the form of anonymized PDF files. At the time of submission, authors will indicate whether they would like the submission to be in the proceedings track (up to 8 pages excluding references) or the extended abstract track (up to 4 pages excluding references).



A submission link and additional details regarding the two submission tracks will be provided on our website at least two weeks prior to the deadline: https://ml4health.github.io



We will have a limited author response period after reviews are released, but we stress that this response period is not a formal rebuttal to reviewer claims, and is instead merely a vehicle to flag severe issues or critical misunderstandings for the meta-reviewer to consider (for example, if the review appears to be for the wrong paper or suffers from a major and transparently verifiable misunderstanding about the work). If the meta-reviewer cannot review your provided response in under 20 minutes and determine that the reviewer made a critical error that clearly affected their recommendation of the paper, the response will be disregarded and will not play a role in the final decision. No new experiments, results/analyses, explanations, text, or additional references (or promises to add such) will be considered in this response period, and submitting a response is in no way required.



To promote community interaction, at least one presenting author of accepted works must register for the workshop.

Registration information can be found here: https://nips.cc/Register/view-registration.

Future networked information systems will support, for example, clinical workflow, remote diagnosis and consultation, e-prescribing, and mobile data collection and surveillance, disease outbreak identification and patient participation in their own well-being and care. Mobile-computing technology may be particularly helpful in improving access to healthcare (geography, monetary and informational), by encouraging personal health management, and by enabling patient and provider mobility. Wearable medical devices are emerging, to measure essential vital signs like pulse, respiration, ECG, blood glucose level, and patient mobility. Handheld devices support clinicians in urban hospitals, and portable diagnostic kits allow remote healthcare teams to more easily reach rural villages.



The widespread availability of mobile phones, and recent experiments with low-cost, long-range broadband wireless networks, bring connectivity to all these opportunities. We encourage papers that present novel ideas for networked computing technology in support of healthcare, and which are likely to invoke thoughtful discussion at the workshop.



Research papers should focus on all aspects of networked healthcare technologies. Of interest, though not exclusively, are the following topics: remote diagnosis and remote consultation



clinical applications of mobile or networked healthcare

mobile and wearable medical sensing applications

design of wearable and home-care health devices

sensor networks for public health monitoring and surveillance

networked mobile technology for rural healthcare

security and privacy in networked healthcare

experience from technology deployments

usability of mobile health applications and devices

applications to emergency response and disaster response

cost-efficient and energy-efficient networking for remote healthcare

remote access to electronic health records



The NetHealth workshop solicits paper submissions of up to 6 pages in length, including all figures, tables, and references. All papers must be electronically submitted in PDF according to the guidelines in the workshop website. The proceedings will be published by IEEE Xplore and will include the final papers of up to 6 pages in length. All NetHealth technical papers must be associated with an author registration at the full rate. For authors presenting multiple papers, one full registration is valid for up to three papers. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the workshop (e.g., removal from IEEE Xplore) if the paper is not presented at the workshop.



Each paper acceptance is subject to the conditions that the paper does not contain any plagiarized material and that the authors do not submit the paper material in parallel to another publication venue. Violations of these conditions will most likely result in rejections of the violating submissions or even already accepted papers."

Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an amalgamation of medical devices and applications that can connect to healthcare information technology (IT) systems using networking technologies. IoMT will promote personalized care and higher standards of care and living through individual data-driven treatment regimens as well as optimized devices tailored to individual physiological requirements. The IoMT sense the patients’ health status and then transfer the clinical data to doctors and care holders with the help of remote cloud data centers. This data is most often used for disease diagnosis and clinical care. The useful information mined from the clinical database is used for preventing and protecting the patient health during situations of emergency. However, the main challenge in IoMT is how to manage with critical applications, where a number of connected devices generate a large amount of medical data. Hence, there is a need for scalable machine learning and intelligent algorithms that lead to more interoperable solutions and that can make effective decisions in emerging IoMT. The goal of this special issue on IoMT for Personalised Healthcare System is to present the state-of-the-art research and applications in utilizing IoMT enabled technology for healthcare systems. Topics to be covered include, but are not limited to:

•	Predictive Modelling for Improving Healthcare in IoMT

The International Conference on Quality of Life returns to it roots in 2019, convening this September 28-29th in Kyoto, Japan. The International Conference on Quality of Life is an inclusive interdisciplinary research/publishing project comprising a wide variety of specialties exploring innovative ways of improving Quality of Life. Open to researchers in Education, Healthcare, Psychology, and Social Sciences (EHPSS) and others.



As global environmental, social, and other challenges to quality of life continue to grow more serious, the need for renewed enthusiasm and novel approaches becomes more urgent; consequently, researchers worldwide who are earnestly looking for insight and solution. We invite researchers to join us in this work by participating in this year's conference. 



Past topics have covered a range of topics in Education, Psychology, Healthcare, Social Sciences, among others. The comfortable and relaxed setting provides a unique forum for developing genuine understanding and insight that transcends disciplinary, national, and other barriers. Please check below for more details on how to participate. We look forward to hearing a variety of stimulating and thought provoking presentations generating lively discussions about new, old, and diverse perspectives on Quality of Life. 





Call for Abstracts/Papers



Through sharing different viewpoints and findings, we can incorporate the latest developments in EHPSS into our own outlook and practice. Those who thirst for knowledge can be satisfied, and those who yearn to endow others can be fullfilled. Those who have a surfeit, can be unburdened, and those who are lacking can be supplied. Those who have progressed can bring others into their company, and those who struggle to move forward can find their road cleared and their pace quickened.



As resources and budgets become tighter, we must all share and participate in the intensive and extensive work of discovering knowledge together, especially so as to avoid wasteful and duplicated effort. By gathering all those who care, we can learn what we need from each other, and eventually improve quality of life - in all its meanings - for all our brothers and sisters in all the four corners of the earth.



Therefore, researchers, practitioners, representatives, artists, consultants, scholars, and others active in EHPSS or other quality of life (QoL) related topics are cordially invited to submit abstracts for oral presentations for ICQol-2019. The types of presentations sought should be in the following categories:

http://www-l2ti.univ-paris13.fr/~boudjit/MobiHealth/

The First ACM MobiHoc Workshop on Pervasive Wireless Healthcare



To be held in conjunction with MobiHoc 2011 http://www.sigmobile.org/mobihoc/2011/

May 16-20, 2011. Paris, France



-----------------------



Technical sponsorship:  ACM SIGMOBILE



-----------------------



Scope of the workshop

-----------------------



Average age of the population tends to increase and the number of people requiring care intensive medical monitoring is not small. This increases overall cost of medical care. Therefore, partially replacing the assistance of nursing staff by small health surveillance and communication equipments like sensors, networks, monitoring software could be cost effective and would also increase life standard. Recent Advances in technology has led to the development of small, intelligent, wearable sensors capable of remotely performing critical health monitoring tasks and then transmitting patient's data back to health care centers over wireless medium. Such wireless health monitoring platforms aim to continuously monitor mobile patients needing permanent surveillance.



However, to set up such platforms several issues along the communication chain should be resolved. The acquisition of medical information via a set of wireless sensors embedded in the patient himself, the treatment and use of this information either by a local contractor equipment or offset after transfer in 3G and/or WiFi connection to a data server, the access to the collected data, ...etc. are some of the important challenges that we have to consider. Each level represents a fairly complex subsystem with a local hierarchy employed to ensure efficiency, portability, security, and reduced cost.



MobileHealth workshop aims to provide a forum for the interaction of these multiple areas and would be an important chance to discuss and understand what aspects have to be considered to provide effective pervasive wireless healthcare systems. The workshop will include presentations of theoretical and experimental achievements, innovative wireless systems, prototyping efforts, case studies and advances in technology related to wireless healthcare networking and systems.



This announcement solicits technical papers describing original, previously unpublished research, not currently under review by another conference or journal. Submissions should clearly identify how they relate to issues on wireless healthcare networking systems. Contributions describing an overall working system are particularly of interest.



Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:



 - Mobile devices for healthcare

 - Wearable and Implantable Wireless sensors for healthcare

 - Communications infrastructure for mobile healthcare apps

 - Protocols for wireless healthcare

 - Scalability, performance and reliability of mobile healthcare apps

 - Pervasive Wireless communications in healthcare

 - Service and device discovery

 - Data fusion and context elaboration

 - Wireless monitoring and ambient assisted applications for healthcare

 - Energy Efficiency in Wireless health monitoring

 - Pervasive Health Systems and Services

 - Authentication and Sensors' monitoring

 - Confidentiality and Data Security

 - Mobile Interfaces for Data Visualization

 - Realizations and Platforms

 - Standards for mobile healthcare

Overview

There is a rapidly moving trend, fueled by both the public and the private sector, toward electronic healthcare systems and devices. These new systems show great potential to improve the administration of healthcare and, ultimately, patient health. However, due to a host of technical shortfalls and a complicated regulatory environment, threats to patient safety, privacy, and security loom large. The focus of this workshop will be on the development of new techniques and policies to ensure the privacy and security of next-generation healthcare systems and devices.



HealthSec is intended as a forum for lively discussion of aggressively innovative and potentially disruptive ideas on all aspects of medical and health security and privacy. We strongly encourage cross-disciplinary interactions between fields, including, but not limited to, technology, medicine, and policy.



For the first time, the HealthSec Program Committee is soliciting previously unpublished, full-length technical papers that concern privacy and security threats, models, architectures, and protections for health information technologies. We will also select shorter position papers that show potential to stimulate or catalyze further research and explore new directions—surprising results and thought-provoking ideas will be strongly favored. Lastly, we hope to repeat last year's lively rump session, open to anyone with work in progress or preliminary results.



We plan to expand this year's workshop to two days, allowing for more time to discuss a wider array of thought-provoking ideas and topics. The format of the workshop will be short presentations by the authors of position papers and longer presentations by authors with full-length papers. Paper presentation will be augmented by break-out discussion groups, expert panels, and a keynote address. The papers will be published on the USENIX Web site.



Topics

Workshop topics are solicited in all areas relating to healthcare information security and privacy, including:

- Access control and consent management systems

- Techniques for analyzing and securing audit logs

- Architectures for large-scale health information systems and health information exchange

- Medical devices and body area networks

- Mobile devices and their use with health and fitness devices

- Home and assisted living monitoring systems

- Threat models: formal descriptions and analysis

- Privacy enhancing technologies such as de-identification and differential privacy for electronic health records generally or specific types of data such as images or genomic data

- Usability and human factors

- Regulatory and policy issues

- Authentication and identification techniques

- Cryptographic protocols



Submissions

Submitted full-length papers must be no longer than ten (10) 8.5"" x 11"" pages. Submitted position papers should be no longer than two (2) 8.5"" x 11"" pages. All papers should be typeset in two-column format in 10 point type on 12 point (single-spaced) leading, with a text block no more than 6.5"" wide by 9"" deep. Submissions are single-blind; authors should include their names and affiliations as part of their submissions. Submissions must be in PDF format and must be submitted via the Web submission form, which will be available here soon.

Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. Submission of work containing plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud.

A series of surveys and reviews report the state-of-the-art technologies special for deep learning methods used in healthcare, and tutorials have been given in recent years at top AI conferences to help audience apply deep learning methods to healthcare applications with heterogeneous data.



Besides healthcare applications, there is still a huge space to uncover the disease-centric computational models, towards a better understanding of the course of a disease. In this workshop, we wish to address the fundamental challenges of building disease computational models based on advanced AI technologies. This calls for methods that can discover:



biological association for disease genotyping

clinical representation for disease phenotyping

probabilistic graph models for disease progression

disease-symptom models for screening or early diagnosis

disease-drug models for optimal care patterns

embedding of medical concepts w./w.o. patient visits

or other novel disease models that potentially put meaningful insights in healthcare.



We welcome original research papers no longer than 5 pages in total: 4 pages for the body of the paper (including all figures), plus up to one additional page with references that do not fit within the six body pages.

MICCAI 2020 Workshop on

Clinical Image-based Procedures: Towards Holistic Patient Models for Personalised Healthcare





October 4, 2020

Virtual event



Website:http://miccai-clip.org/

==============================

==========================================



SCOPE



CLIP is about the effective translation of computational image-based techniques into the clinic filling the gaps between medical imaging, basic science and clinical applications. As it nowadays becomes more and more important for many clinical applications to base decisions not only on image data alone, a focus of CLIP 2020 is on the creation of holistic patient models. Here, image data such as radiologic images, microscopy images, and photographs is combined with non-image information such as ‘omics’ data (e.g. genomics, proteomics), life style data, demographics, EEG, and other to build a more complete picture of the individual patient and to subsequently provide better diagnosis and therapies.



CLIP 2020 provides a forum for work centered on specific clinical applications, including techniques and procedures based on comprehensive clinical image and other data. Submissions related to applications already in use and evaluated by clinical users are particularly encouraged. We explicitly welcome novel techniques and applications that are looking at combining image analysis with clinical data mining and analytics, user studies, and other heterogeneous data.



Please note: MICCAI announced holding MICCAI 2020 as a fully virtual event in light of the ongoing pandemic which means that CLIP 2020 will follow this format. Paper proceedings will be published as planned and accepted papers will have pre-recorded presentations with live Q&A.



TOPICS





* Combination of image analysis with other heterogeneous data including radiography images, microscopy, photographs, genomics, proteomics, life style data, EEG, bio-data, and other

* Multimodal image integration for modeling, planning and guidance

* Strategies for patient-specific and anatomical modeling to support planning and interventions

* Clinical studies employing advanced image-guided methods

* Clinical translation and validation of image-guided systems

* Current challenges and emerging techniques in image-based procedures

* Clinical applications in open and minimally invasive procedures





PAPER SUBMISSION



Papers can be up to 10 pages. All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 members of the program committee. Reviewing is double-blind so authors have to prepare their manuscripts such that their identity cannot be derived from their submission. The selection of papers will be based on the significance of results, novelty, technical merit, relevance and clarity of presentation.



Electronic paper proceedings will be arranged. The papers will be published in a Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) proceeding. LNCS is indexed by Scopus, ACM Digital Library, DBLP, Conference Proceedings Citation Index (part of Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science), and others.



WORKSHOP FORMAT



Papers will be presented in a day long single track workshop starting with plenary sessions. The final program will consist of previously unpublished and contributed papers with substantial time allocated to discussion.



IMPORTANT DATES



* June 30, 2020: Paper submission due date

* July 21, 2020: Notification of acceptance

* July 31, 2020: Final camera-ready paper submission deadline

                  Special track call for papers

              Security and Privacy in Healthcare IT (SPH2013) 

  In the 26th IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS2013)

               20th to 22th June, 2013. Porto, Portugal





We are currently witnessing a rapidly moving transition trend towards

electronic healthcare  information systems.  They have already proved

to be essential tools in order to improve the management  and quality

of  healthcare  services.  More recently,  these  systems  have  also

started  to  promote  great  results  on the improvement of patients’

health  by enabling the creation of much more flexible, efficient and

interoperable means by which practitioners and even patients can have

access and manage  healthcare  data.  However  very complex technical

challenges  resulting  from  strict  but  necessary  highly regulated

environments,  threats to  patient safety, privacy, and security must

be  tackled  and  solved  before  we  can  safely  have  valuable and

sensitive patient’s data being securely managed and used in much more

flexible and potentially useful ways.  Towards  this  end  it is thus

imperative to develop innovative methods and policies that ensure the

secure acquisition  and  management  of  healthcare data, at the same

time promoting its interoperability,  its' sharing, and its integrity

and confidentiality in highly effective and secure ways.



This  special track  focuses  on  original  unpublished  research  on

innovative methods, policies and  concerns  that  can  constitute the

right building blocks  for  a new generation of electronic healthcare

information  systems  that  are  at  the  same  time  more efficient,

empowering  and  secure.  So,  it  is  expected  novel articles about

privacy,  security,  accountability  and  auditing for the healthcare

sector.  This  special track  also pretends to encourage the research

dissemination to the stakeholders involved  in healthcare information

technologies,  promoting  the  discussion  on  issues, challenges and

solutions that are currently being developed all around the world.



Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:



 *  Access control and consent management models;

 *  Authentication and identification concepts;

 *  Security and privacy concerns in healthcare;

 *  Biometrics in healtcare;

 *  Health data protection;

 *  Policy and Legal aspects of regulating privacy of health data;

 *  Healthcare in cloud computing;

 *  Mobile devices and their use in healthcare information systems;

 *  Patient empowerment;

 *  Personal health records;

 *  Usability and human factors;



The  most  relevant  articles  will be invited to submit an extended 

version on the Journal of Health, Policy and Technology published by

Elsevier.



Each contribution must be prepared  following  the  IEEE  two-column

format,  and should not exceed the length of six Letter-sized pages;

the authors may use LaTeX or Microsoft Word templates when preparing

their drafts.  The papers should  be submitted electronically before

the paper  submission deadline using the EasyChair online submission

system. Papers must be submitted in PDF format, with fonts embedded.



All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least two reviewers. The

SPH2013 program committee will be responsible for the final decision

about acceptance of articles submitted.  All accepted papers will be

included in the conference proceedings, and will be published by the

IEEE.  At  least  one  author must pay the registration fee for each

accepted paper.  Please  refer to the IEEE IPR guidelines concerning

copyright.  Authors of accepted papers must include a completed IEEE

Copyright Form with the submission of their final camera-ready paper.

To succeed in transforming healthcare, many countries will need to 

move to more targeted healthcare. Successful migration must encourage 

innovation, provide access to more complete patient information and 

incorporate advanced clinical knowledge into clinical decision-making. 

Aiming at successfully transforming healthcare, some interdependent 

challenges need to be overcome, such as prevalence of tightly coupled 

applications and data; inadequate data and knowledge standards; 

insufficient analytics capabilities; unsatisfactory security and 

privacy methodologies; absence of a clinical decision-making foundation. 

Knowledge discovery and data mining techniques, especially data 

analytics, have been proven holding much promise for solving these 

problems. Providers can use health care data analytics to learn about 

patient populations, enhance preventive care and drive business 

decisions by accessing key data such as demographics and chronic 

conditions. Therefore, nowadays the healthcare industry requires a much 

more open, robust health information technology environment than ever 

existed, especially the techniques and methodologies in knowledge 

discovery and data mining.



Targeting on these interesting questions, following the success of the 

first edition (DANTH 2013) the second, DANTH 2013 workshop focuses on how 

data analytics can improve information management in healthcare. The 

workshop will bring together researchers from different countries and 

regions to foster dissemination, increase the share of knowledge cross 

different domains, and strengthen the research on data analytic 

techniques and related applications to healthcare problems.

The medical care is increasingly associated with and reliant upon concepts of and advances in electronics and electromagnetics. Recent technological advances in sensors, low-power microelectronics, miniaturization, and wireless networking have enabled the design and proliferation of wireless body area networks capable of autonomously monitoring and controlling different applications.



One of the most promising applications of body area networks is for human health monitoring. A number of tiny wireless sensors, strategically placed on/in the human body, create a wireless body area network that can monitor various vital signs, providing real-time feedback to the user and medical personnel. Communications from in-body implants and on-body sensors will allow for better diagnoses and improve therapy. The wireless body area networks promise to revolutionize health monitoring.



Healthcare systems can be significantly improved with lower cost and higher quality of services by using ultra wideband new emerging technologies. These benefits and impacts have fuelled increasing interest from the public and have attracted significant support and investment from government, industrial and academic researchers. Challenges facing the UWB wireless communications in healthcare systems include:



    * the design of architectures among wireless communications for supporting secure and

    * reliable signal propagation with low network latency;

    * channel modelling and RF and propagation close to body;

    * waveform destruction due to body tissue;

    * accurate indoor positioning; emergency response and detection;

    * the need for privacy preservation of patients and

    * the definition of healthcare policy and legal issues towards potential new applications.



This special issue aims for covering the state-of-the-art research on ultra wideband emerging wireless technologies and applications in healthcare, highlighting research challenges and open issues and bringing together researchers and medical professionals from academia, industry and government with the goal of fostering collaboration among them. Original, unpublished contributions and invited articles, reflecting those aspects of UWB communication research in healthcare, distinctly different from the wireless communication research in general, are encouraged.

The convergence of physiological sensors, signal processing, pattern recognition, machine learning, cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology and biomedical engineering produces exciting new ideas for solving a variety of complex problems in human-machine interface and healthcare applications. During the last decades, growing interest has been aroused in exploiting electrical nature of the human nervous system for neural human-machine interfacing, using EEG, ECG, EMG, EOG, GSR, etc. In addition to the autonomic nervous signals, researchers employ extrinsic physiological channels including speech, facial expression, and gesture to approach affective human-machine interfaces. Some of these modalities can be successfully combined for human-like decision making. A fascinating fact is that such physiological measurements can also offer great potential for daily healthcare monitoring. Moreover, recently the medical mainstream recognizes the health/healing power of various environmental elements including social activity, diet and nutrition, joy and stress, family, and lifestyle. All of these aspects extend the scope of applying physiological signals to multi-disciplinary research fields. The aim of this workshop is to assemble researchers from diverse backgrounds together to discuss their ideas and solutions and to build a new vision.

The goal of the first workshop on Knowledge Discovery in Healthcare Data is to foster discussion and present progress on research efforts that leverage large amounts of observational data (clinical, biological, physiological) to expedite discovery in medicine. The workshop is intended to encourage a cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas between medical researchers and the artificial intelligence community.



Healthcare datasets consisting of both structured and unstructured information provide a challenge for artificial intelligence and machine learning researchers seeking to extract knowledge from data. Rich healthcare datasets exist, including electronic medical records, large collections of complex physiological information, medical imaging data, genomics, as well as other socio-economic and behavioral data. In order to perform data-driven analysis or build causal models using these datasets, challenges need to be addressed, such as integrating multiple data types, dealing with missing data and handling irregularly sampled data. While these challenges need to be taken into account by researchers working with healthcare data, a larger problem involves how to best ensure the hypotheses posed and types of knowledge discoveries sought are relevant to the healthcare community. Clinical perspectives from medical care professionals are required to assure that advancements in healthcare data analysis results in positive impact to eventual point-of-care and outcome-based systems.



The process of discovery in medicine starts with a small set of observations and many pre-clinical and clinical trials on different patient population cohorts. Heterogeneous environments, uncertainties in original hypotheses, the passage of time and accumulating costs make medical discovery a complex process. An example of such a discovery is metabolic syndrome. The concept of metabolic syndrome evolved over 90 years to reach our current point of understanding. It is now known that the syndrome occurs as a cluster of metabolic and medical disorders, including obesity, impaired control of blood glucose, high levels of fat in the blood, and high blood pressure. The hope of knowledge discovery in healthcare data is to expedite such discoveries.



Artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches hold the potential to reveal not readily apparent, hidden information in biological and medical healthcare datasets. The results of such discoveries can aid the development of novel diagnostic and prognostic tests, inform descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics and guide hypothesis generation. By combining advances in algorithmic and computational approaches together with perspectives from medical care professionals the hope of this workshop is to ensure advancements result in positive impact and relevance to the healthcare community.

In the last recent years, technology-enabled coaching in healthcare has shown a real potential to mitigate and overcome a series of limitations of National Healthcare Systems on providing timely and good quality treatment to patients. Such limitations include the uneven relationship between number of health professionals and patients and the other criticalities raised by the challenging actual scenario in which more people live longer with chronic diseases while they need incremental support and treatment from health and care professionals. On this picture, Virtual Coaching responds as a possible way to mitigate the challenges above by providing an intermediate layer of attention between patients and health professionals. In this way, support to patients can take advantage of various methods and technologies such as those rendered available today by Artificial Intelligence, big data analytics, personalised approaches to health and care, behaviour change and persuasive technologies, etc. The objective of this workshop is to discuss where we are today on Virtual Coaching research and roadmap the basis for future research topics in this field that is in a transition from its childhood towards more mature horizons.



***



Background and Motivation



The overall topic of the workshop is on the future of coaching systems for healthcare. The topic is of particular interest at this point of time since discussions on ICT-based coaching reached a maturity level that will transit in the next years from an emerging field to a consolidated one. In particular latest approaches focused on AI-supported coaching have succeeded to enter into the clinical domain discussions as an opportunity of empowering in one hand the citizens and in the other as a way to overcome limitations of healthcare systems such as lack of enough healthcare professionals through step-based approaches. The main need of establishing the future steps in research on this regard is that even if preliminary developments have demonstrated potential in this field, there are still a lot of unanswered questions. There is a need into further development to come to personalized, preventive, predictive and participative (P4) health care. As is still needed a more clear identification of potential benefits that confluence of technologies and methods may provide towards a more thorough definition of the research agenda in this domain.



***



Topics



We invite 4-pages position papers responding to fundamental questions regarding the future of virtual coaching in health such as (but not restricted to) the following:



- Where Virtual Coaching for Health field is moving to?

- What is the relevant research for the future?

- Will it be connected only to technology or are there other fundamental aspects to bring into?

- Which are the priorities for new directions of research?

- How personalisation will be tackled by future health virtual coaches?

- How future virtual coaching interfaces will look like?

- How ethics, privacy, and regulations will impact on future vIrtual coaching?

- How technology needs to evolve for next generation virtual coaching?



***



Publication and Submission



Workshop Papers will be published in a dedicated section of the Pervasive Health Conference Proceedings. The materials presented in the position papers should not be published or under submission elsewhere. All submissions will be reviewed by the Program Committee and external experts to reach a decision on acceptance.



The outcome of the workshop is intended to enable the organizers and participants to produce a joint roadmap and a reference manifesto for the future of Virtual Coaching research in the following 10 years to be submitted for consideration to a scientific Journal to be decided together among the various co-authors.

Fast-growing biomedical and healthcare data have encompassed multiple scales ranging from molecules, individuals, to populations and have connected various entities in healthcare systems (providers, pharma, payers) with increasing bandwidth, depth, and resolution. Those data are becoming an enabling resource for accelerating basic science discoveries and facilitating evidence-based clinical solutions. Meanwhile, the sheer volume and complexity of the data present major barriers toward their translation into effective clinical actions. There is thus a compelling demand for novel algorithms, including machine learning, data mining and optimization, that specifically tackle the unique challenges associated with biomedical and healthcare data and allow decision-makers and stakeholders to better interpret and exploit the data.

				

The First International Workshop on Biomedical infOrmatics with Optimization and Machine learning (BOOM), which will be held in conjunction with the 25th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), aims at catalyzing synergies among biomedical informatics, machine learning, and optimization as well as fostering interactions among a diverse audience of applied mathematicians, computer scientists, industrial engineers, bioinformaticians, computational biologists, clinicians and healthcare researchers.



BOOM-16 solicits (1) full papers that describe original research work that have not been published before, which will be published in a special issue of EURASIP Journal on Bioinformatics and Systems Biology (JBSB; see http://www.bsb.eurasipjournals.com/about/update/BIOML) and (2) short abstracts that either highlight significant works that have been published or accepted recently or report unpublished research findings, which will be included in workshop proceedings.  



All submissions will be considered for oral and poster presentations at BOOM.  The decision on presentation format for accepted submissions will be based primarily on an assessment of breadth of interest, and the construction of balanced and topically coherent sessions, while full papers will be given some priority for oral presentations.  We will give out best presentation awards sponsored by Microsoft. We are also seeking funding for travel awards for students or postdocs. 









Topics of interest



We encourage submissions from, but not limited to, the following inter-linked areas:



Category I: Machine Learning and Optimization Algorithms



●	Applying cutting-edge machine learning (e.g., deep learning) and optimization techniques to tackle real-world medical and healthcare problems.



●	Addressing challenges and roadblocks in biomedical informatics with reference to the data-driven machine learning, such as imbalanced dataset, weakly-structured or unstructured data, noisy and ambiguous labeling, and more.



●	Designing novel, applicable numerical optimization algorithms for biomedical data, that is usually large-scale, high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and noisy.



●	Re-visiting traditional machine learning topics such as clustering, classification, regression and dimension reduction, that find application values in newly-emerging biomedical informatic problems.



●	Other closely-related disciplines, such as image processing, data mining, new computing technologies and paradigms (e.g., cloud computing), control theory, and system engineering.



Category II: Biomedical Informatics Applications



●	Computational Biology, including the advanced interpretation of critical biological findings, using databases and cutting-edge computational infrastructure.



●	Clinical Informatics, including the scenarios of using computation and data for health care, spanning medicine, dentistry, nursing, pharmacy, and allied health. 



●	Public Health Informatics, including the studies of patients and populations to improve the public health system and to elucidate epidemiology.



We encourage papers with important new insights and experiences at the intersection of machine learning, optimization and bioinformatics. Those contributions should shed light on at least one topic mentioned above, while the above topics have obvious overlaps. For topics in Category I, we invite both theoretically novel and application-driven papers. For those in Category II, the idea is to keep the interested application domain focused yet broad, echoing multiple scales, ranging from molecules, individuals, to populations.

As researchers from both academia and industry strive towards the goals of improving the patients’ quality of life and reducing health costs, Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) 

are one of the very promising research areas that can help achieve both goals. If properly deployed, BSNs can continuously gather physiological data from the human body and 

use it for healthcare monitoring, including patient self-assessment, remote diagnosis and chronic disease management. The importance of BSNs towards the goal of ubiquitous monitoring 

of health anywhere and anytime is even greater when taking into account their possible utilization for augmented sensory stimulation for people with hearing and visual impairments, 

as well as for improved support of the aging population, worldwide. In parallel, BSNs offer a range of opportunities when applied in the sports and cyber-physical security domains.

However, a number of issues related to the efficiency of BSNs are yet to be sufficiently addressed. Sensors are placed on the human body or clothes, and hence the network 

has to face constantly changing wireless channel characteristics with the movement of the body. Issues such as interference, energy consumption, security of the transmitted 

information, as well as the limited resources of the wireless medium when multiple devices try to transmit, are all open and challenging research problems to address; coupled 

with the development of new applications that will further enhance the value of BSNs, they compose distinct research challenges from a networking, communications as well 

as a system-oriented viewpoint.



Call for Papers



This special issue is devoted to covering all aspects of theoretical research and practical implementations of body sensor networks (BSNs) and aims to provide a forum for 

researchers and practitioners to present and discuss their most recent contributions in the field. Previously unpublished, original papers of high quality that are not currently 

under review by another journal or conference are solicited on (but not limited to) the following topics of interest:

•	Novel BSN applications

•	Energy-efficiency for BSNs

•	Quality of service and Quality of Experience for BSNs

•	Security and privacy for BSNs

•	BSN system architecture

•	Interference mitigation in BSNs

5th International Workshop on

Software Engineering in Health Care

http://sehc.info/sehc2013.htm



In Conjunction with ICSE 2013, May 18-26, 2013, San Francisco, California http://2013.icse-conferences.org/

Workshop dates: Monday, May 20th and Tuesday, May 21st, 2013 





Workshop overview

Our ability to deliver timely, effective and cost efficient healthcare services remains one of the world’s foremost challenges. The challenge has numerous dimensions including: (a) the need to develop a highly functional yet secure electronic health record system that integrates a multitude of incompatible existing systems, (b) in-home patient support systems to reduce demand on professional health-care facilities, and (c) innovative technical devices such as advanced pacemakers that support other healthcare procedures. Responding to this challenge will necessitate increased development and usage of software-intensive systems in all aspects of healthcare services. However the increased digitization of healthcare will require articulation of extensive requirements related to the development, use, evolution, and integration of health software in areas such as volume and dependability, interoperability, usability, and the safety and security of associated devices. The goal of the fifth workshop on Software Engineering for Health Care (SEHC) is to discuss recent research innovations and to continue developing an interdisciplinary community to develop a research, educational and industrial agenda for supporting software engineering in the health care sector.



Example Topics for Submission

At the 2011 SEHC we began development of a framework for SEHC. A Wiki with our progress to date is at https://xserve.cs.uvic.ca/wiki/projects/sehcwiki/SEHC_Community_Wiki.html.  At the 2012 workshop we continued to develop the agenda and identified specific challenges to software engineering to support healthcare delivery. The challenges are: system quality, compliance and regulatory issues, revolution of the software development process, medical process support and improvement, data management and analytics, enabling a global reach of healthcare delivery, and software support for the transformation of healthcare delivery (i.e. evidence based medicine, patient centered care, assisted living, patient safety). For the 2013 SEHC workshop we invite submissions that explore the above challenges (as well as other software engineering topics relevant to health care systems and processes) and the role that software engineering plays in developing solutions to address them.  



Submission Details

With the above topics as a starting point, the SEHC 2013 workshop invites broad participation from people who are actively involved in research and development of software engineering in healthcare. To accommodate for the participation of projects in different stages of maturity, we seek a variety of contributions, including short papers, tool descriptions, clinical case studies and research results papers.

With the development of society, health has received increasing attentions. The development of science and technology has also promoted the protection of health. In recent years, the rapid development of computing and networking technologies has improved the ability to collect, measure, and analyze health-related data, and thus tremendous opportunities have opened up for healthcare computing. Meanwhile, these technologies have also brought new challenges and issues. For example, patients’ diagnostic records stored in hospital management systems may be tampered with, which may affect the patients’ health management and insurance compensation. Blockchain has received increasing attention from academia and industry in recent years. It enables transparent interactions of different parties in a more secure and trusted network. The traceability of blockchain allows data to be retained on the blockchain from every step of the data generation process, to endorse the quality of the data and to ensure the correctness of data analysis and mining. The content recorded in the blockchain cannot be tampered with, so it can be used to record important information in health management, provide accurate and reliable health knowledge for network users, and provide accurate information for auditing. 



This special issue aims to attract contributions from academic and industrial organizations addressing emerging issues in blockchain and healthcare computing (blockchain combined with computing for healthcare). 



Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

- The design and implementation of testbed and infrastructure of blockchain in computing for healthcare

- Blockchain and medical devices

- Blockchain and wearables (mobile healthcare with blockchain)

- Access control of healthcare information based on blockchain

- Blockchain for data collection and analysis in healthcare computing

- Blockchain for communication network management in healthcare computing

- Payment system based on blockchain in healthcare

- Accountability in healthcare computing based on blockchain

- Theories about blockchain evolution in healthcare computing

However, a big majority of such partnerships do not succeed and terminate with little or no benefits to either party. This conference will shed light on industrial engineering techniques and practices that may help organizations and universities in their quest to build successful university – industry alliances.



The 3rd GCETM is a highly anticipated conference due to the popularity of the field. The 3rd GCETM is set to become an exciting event with the potential for continued growth throughout the years. The 3rd GCETM will be a forum for academics, managers and solution providers, which brings together researchers and practitioners from all over the world, promoting opportunities to share experiences, debate ideas, identify tendencies, and introduce the latest developments in the largely multidisciplinary field of Engineering & Technology Management. This is especially important since this field can largely benefit from increased collaboration. The 3rd GCETM will take place from July 14th to July 15th at the Elite World Istanbul Hotel in Istanbul, Turkey.



Istanbul is the only city in the world built on two continents. Its rich history has given it a multitude of museums, historical buildings and mosques, Byzantine churches and Roman aqueducts. This exciting venue is alive with the hustle and bustle of business and trade which for centuries has made it a vital trading hub between east and west. Straddling Europe and Asia, Istanbul is the largest and most monumental city in Turkey, and is a melting pot of cultures which mix harmoniously on both sides of a city split geographically by the Bosphorus strait. This bustling city is home to over 13 million people, and from 14 to 15 July 2016, will also be home to the 3rd GCETM."

Facilities for psychiatric care have a tradition of standardization in design and treatment dating back to the moral treatment paradigm of the 1850s. As normative approaches to psychiatric care have changed, so too do the facilities used to house, treat and manage patients. The shift to evidence-based design (EBD) in hospital architecture means that the psychiatric milieu must follow suit.



The search for evidence to model psychiatric facilities is an important endeavour. But psychiatric illness is not like orthopaedics or cardiology, where the needs and satisfaction of staff and patients can be relatively easy to assess and evidence can be easily measured.



Mental illnesses are a heterogeneous group of disorders, and there is a risk in categorizing all psychiatric illnesses together and treating them alike. Environmental influences that exacerbate one condition frequently assist with another. As such, Facilities is soliciting approaches that are specific to:

. model of care (functional program)

. Procurement and governance

. geriatric psychiatry

. mood disorders

. the non-affective psychotic spectrum

. psychiatric emergencies

. substance-related disorders

. facilities for forensic psychiatry.

This list is not exhaustive and interested authors are encouraged to

contact the Guest Editor with alternative proposals. Please kindly take

note of the following requirements if you wish to have your paper

considered for this special issue:

. The content of the paper must conform with the terms of reference of

Facilities

. All papers submitted will be subject to the normal double blind

refereeing process undertaken by the journal

. Submitted papers must not be under review by any other journal.

The closing date for submissions is: 1 June 2012

There is an increasing trend toward moving medical information to digital systems. This trend has materialized in the form of medical information sharing—both within internal and federated medical systems and in cloud systems such as Google Health and Microsoft HealthVault. This trend has also materialized in the form of advanced medical care, ranging from next-generation medical devices in the home and in the operating room to remote robotic medical devices on the battlefield. The focus of this workshop will be on protecting the security and privacy of these next-generation medical and healthcare systems.

HealthSec is intended as a forum for lively discussion of aggressively innovative and potentially disruptive ideas on all aspects of medical and health security and privacy. A fundamental goal of the workshop is to promote cross-disciplinary interactions between fields, including, but not limited to, technology, medicine, and policy. Surprising results and thought-provoking ideas will be strongly favored; complete papers with polished results in well-explored research areas are comparatively discouraged. Position papers will be selected for their potential to stimulate or catalyze further research and explorations of new directions, as well as for their potential to spark productive discussions at the workshop.



The format of the workshop will be short presentations by the authors of the position papers, followed by break-out discussion groups. We expect the workshop to be highly interactive. There will be no published proceedings, but authors of accepted position papers will be expected to make their papers available on their own Web sites by July 28, 2010, and to provide the program chairs with the URLs to the papers by July 28 as well.



Topics



Workshop topics are solicited in all areas relating to healthcare information security and privacy, including:

Security and privacy models for healthcare information systems

Industrial experiences in healthcare information systems

Deployment of open systems for secure and private use of healthcare information technology

========================================================================================



In recent years substantial budgets have been and are being committed towards e-healthcare. 

For example, as part of the stimulus package the Obama administration is going to spend 19 

Billion dollars in healthcare. A significant part of this budget will be spent on making sure 

that all Americans have Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs) by 2014. The move towards e-health

care is envisaged to reduce the cost of provision of healthcare, improve quality of care and 

reduce medical errors. Despite all these advantages the security concerns are real and going to 

increase as the rate we digitise information and use the web increases. Major security issues 

include patient privacy, trust, and quality-assurance. Security concerns are affecting the adoption

rate and usage of e-healthcare information systems. Unless deliberate efforts are taken to secure 

these systems from design to implementation most of the development achieved to date may not be 

realised and rolled out to the real world.



This workshop will bring together researchers and industry participants who are involved either in 

the design, development, and implementation of novel secure e-healthcare Information systems or in 

the research that addresses the key questions in the enhancement of privacy and security of e-health

care information. We expect the work to be presented in this workshop to address security and privacy

problems and solutions that can be used in distributed and heterogeneous computer systems as well as 

in mobile devices, which will characterise the emerging e-healthcare environment. 



The security and privacy issues in e-healthcare Information Systems that are covered in this workshop 

are also becoming important now in digital information management in general. These issues will also 

have significant effect in other emerging application areas such as cloud computing. We, therefore, 

welcome original, high-quality research contributions that advance the state-of-the-art in the design, 

development, deployment, evaluation and understanding of secure e-healthcare information systems.

http://www.tinyurl.com/medcomm



ACM MedCOMM invites papers that stimulate research in communications

or computer networks with application to medical device communication

systems. Key properties include safety, effectiveness, reliability,

and security.



There is an increasing trend toward the convergence of wireless

communication, Internet connectivity, and medicine. Devices with

advanced computer communication range from body-worn health monitors

to implantable medical devices to remote robotic medical devices in

the battlefield. A growing list of such devices includes artificial

vision, brain-computer interfaces for prosthetics, cardiac monitors,

defibrillators, digital mamography, glucose monitors, infusion pumps,

insulin pumps, neurostimulators, pacemakers, radiological electronic

picture archiving and communication systems, and smart stents. All

these systems depend on the safe, effective, reliable, and secure

communication and computer networking. Advanced research on medical

communication systems will help innovators of next-generation medical

technologies that aim to improve public health in the digital age.

Fast-growing biomedical and healthcare data have encompassed multiple scales ranging from molecules, individuals, to populations and have connected various entities in healthcare systems  (providers, pharma, payers) with increasing bandwidth, depth, and resolution. Those data are becoming an enabling resource for accelerating basic science discoveries and facilitating evidence-based clinical solutions. Meanwhile, the sheer volume and complexity of the data present major barriers toward their translation into effective clinical actions. There is thus a compelling demand for novel algorithms, including machine learning, data mining and optimization, that specifically tackle the unique challenges associated with biomedical and healthcare data and allow decision-makers and stakeholders to better interpret and exploit the data.



Recent years have witnessed major breakthroughs in machine learning that is equipped with powerful optimization technologies. For example, the concept of “deep learning” often leads to automated feature discovery from data and it has achieved impressive performances than traditional learning methods when processing large unstructured corpora. For biomedical informatics needs, deep learning methods have recently made notable advances in processing brain-imaging data and making neuroscience discovery, although their utilities to more biomedical informatics use-cases still awaits further assessment. On a general note, biomedical data often feature large volumes, high dimensions, imbalance between classes, heterogeneous sources, noises, incompleteness, and rich contexts. Such demanding features are also driving the development of numerical optimization algorithms in tandem with that of machine learning algorithms.

​

The BOOM workshop aims at catalyzing synergies among biomedical informatics, machine learning, and optimization. This workshop is targeting an audience of applied mathematicians, computer scientists, industrial engineers, bioinformaticians, computational biologists, clinicians and healthcare researchers who are interested in exploring the emerging and fascinating interdisciplinary topics. It is designed to foster exchange of ideas between often-disparate groups that are unaware of each other's research, and to stimulate fruitful collaborations among different disciplines.​







Topics of Interests



We encourage submissions from, but not limited to, the following inter-linked areas:



Category I: Machine Learning and Optimization Algorithms

●	Applying cutting-edge machine learning (e.g., deep learning) and optimization techniques to tackle real-world medical and healthcare problems. 



●	Addressing challenges and roadblocks in biomedical informatics with reference to the data-driven machine learning, such as imbalanced dataset, weakly-structured or unstructured data, noisy and ambiguous labeling, and more. 



●	Designing novel, applicable numerical optimization algorithms for biomedical data, that is usually large-scale, high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and noisy. 



●	Re-visiting traditional machine learning topics such as clustering, classification, regression and dimension reduction, that find application values in newly-emerging biomedical informatic problems. 



●	Other closely-related disciplines, such as image processing, data mining, new computing technologies and paradigms (e.g., cloud computing), control theory, and system engineering. 





Category II: Biomedical Informatics Applications

●	Computational Biology, including the advanced interpretation of critical biological findings, using databases and cutting-edge computational infrastructure. 



●	Clinical Informatics, including the scenarios of using computation and data for health care, spanning medicine, dentistry, nursing, pharmacy, and allied health. 



●	Public Health Informatics, including the studies of patients and populations to improve the public health system and to elucidate epidemiology. 



●	mHealth Applications, including the use of mobile apps and wearable sensors for health management and wellness promotion.



●	Cyber-Informatics Applications, including the use of social media data mining and natural language processing for clinical insight discovery and medical decision making.

​

We encourage papers with important new insights and experiences at the intersection of machine learning, optimization and bioinformatics. Those contributions should shed light on at least one topic mentioned above, while the above topics have obvious overlaps. For topics in Category I, we invite both theoretically novel and application-driven papers. For those in Category II, the idea is to keep the interested application domain focused yet broad, echoing multiple scales, ranging from molecules, individuals, to populations.





Submission 



The IJCAI BOOM’17 workshop solicits:

(1)  Full Papers (6-8 pages + reference) that describe original research work that have not been published before, which will be published in a special issue of EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing (JASP). 

(2) short abstracts (1 page) that either highlight significant works that have been published or accepted recently or report unpublished research findings, which will be included in workshop online proceedings (unarchived).

MOTIVATION AND SCOPE 

Developed countries worldwide are facing a rapidly growing elderly population and a declining workforce, as a result of increased life expectancy and decreased birth rates. According to the United Nations, the elderly, defined as people over the age of 60, will make up 37% of the European population by 2050, from 20% in 2000. With ageing, probability increases of developing physical and cognitive impairments, requiring new and more effective ways to provide support and care. IoT technology may provide significant enhancement to quality of life for the elderly and, in general, people in need. Effective solutions for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) require appropriate ICT algorithms, architectures and platforms, that cannot leave out of consideration the development of new and innovative approaches, particularly in the area of pervasive and mobile systems. The personal communication between elderly people, their environment, and relevant groups of care givers is an important aspect in AAL; such a need for a pervasive connectivity may leverage the IoT capabilities, to connect humans to smart objects, and put smart objects at the service of users’ needs. At the same time, the realm of Active and Assisted Living may provide a way to capitalize the vast amount of research and knowledge developed up to know in the manifold aspects and facets of IoT. This workshop aims at investigating the close relationship among IoT and AAL, to identify effective approaches towards an increased Quality of Life for the current and future ageing populations. Among the different technical issues that have to be considered when designing IoT solutions for AAL, some of them emerge as critical, i.e.: low power communication technologies and energy-saving design at different layers, and in a cross-layer approach; security and privacy issues, both at the single node/object level, and in a system/platform perspective; big data, analytics, and signal processing for AAL enabled by an IoT approach; cloud and mobile cloud architectures supporting AAL through IoT. IoTAAL will bring researchers from the IoT field and the AAL field together, to foster a better common understanding, to exchange visions and latest research results addressing IoT specialization for AAL, to discuss promising new technologies and to highlight open research challenges.

AMCIS 2011 Healthcare Mini-Track Call for Papers



Two recent reviews of the electronic health record (EHR) literature show that all is not well especially with respect to the alignment of organizational design and the engineered artifact.  Niazkhani et al (2009, p. 546) concluded ""When put in practice, the formal, predefined, stepwise, and role-based models of workflow underlying CPOE systems may show a fragile compatibility with the contingent, pragmatic, and co-constructive nature of workflow.”  Two of the findings of Greenhalgh et al (2009, p. 767) were “while secondary work (audit, research, billing) may be made more efficient by the EPR, primary clinical work is often made less efficient” and “the EPR may support, but will not drive, changes in the social order of the workplace”.  In addition, Fontaine et al (2010) concluded from a systematic literature review in primary care that “The potential for HIE to reduce costs and improve the quality of health care in ambulatory primary care practices is well recognized but needs further empiric substantiation “.



Just as in enterprise resource planning (ERP) adoption, healthcare organizations (HCOs) expect Healthcare Information Technology (HCIT) to shape their organization design through the embedded workflow engineered most often from a mechanistic worldview.  Oftentimes the contingencies and exceptions aren’t accounted for leaving the blame to fall upon the usual reasons for HCIT failure (e.g., poor implementation, lack of training, resistance).  Organizational Design and Engineering (ODE) takes the position that the “either-or” mindset must be replaced with a more holistic view of designing the organization and artifact.  The complex interplay between organization and engineering, oftentimes intangible, requires a multi-disciplinary approach to solve the challenge of the social and technological world of healthcare being inextricably linked to healthcare policy.



The mini-track seeks contributions from the spectrum of disciplines that are involved in HCIT whose paper focus has both the elements of organizational design and an engineered artifact regardless of research or discipline orientation.  These might address theoretical, empirical and design-based studies on medical-technical infrastructures, tools and applications, health information behavior, cost/benefits as well as social implications.  HCIT’s are broadly defined to include technologies in clinical informatics, E-health, M-Health, consumer health, public health, and health policy.



 Best papers will be fast-tracked to a special issue on HCIT with The International Journal of Organisational Design and Engineering  (IJODE) due out in second half 2011.  Contact the co-chairs if you have questions about submission and fit of your contribution with IJODE.

Accurate localisation and positioning are becoming increasingly important for a wide range of applications including healthcare applications. Conventional localisation techniques are not suitable for healthcare due to the mobility and dynamics of patients. In addition, these techniques do not provide immediate, secure and accurate positioning information of patients in life-critical situations.

 

There is an urgent need to develop novel localisation and positioning techniques for healthcare applications, which must be able to accurately locate patients during abnormal circumstances. For example, these novel techniques may be able to interact with body area networks in order to locate patients who are expecting a heart attack.

 

Also, recent advances in cloud computing, including cloud storage, cloud database, and cloud collaboration, offer tremendous opportunities for patient localisation. By leveraging the opportunities and advantages offered by cloud computing, cloud-assisted localisation has the potential to revolutionise localisation and promises a new era of localisation in healthcare applications.

 

This special issue invites present research and review articles in order to promote research activities on localisation and positioning for healthcare applications. Original analytical, experimental and systems-related papers on the theme will be considered.

 

Subject Coverage

 

Topics include but are not limited to:



Cloud-assisted data processing, mining and fusion for patient localisation

1. Humanitarian Relief and Development

2. Responsible AI in Healthcare



AI technology can have an incredible impact on how we address humanitarian issues and achieve sustainable developmental goals. The advances in AI can be utilized detecting and predicting how a crisis or conflict could develop, analyzing the impact of catastrophes in a cyber-physical society, and assisting in disaster response as well as resource allocation. Such AI techniques can allow better preparation for emergencies, help save lives, limit economic losses, provide adequate disaster relief, and make communities more reliable and resilient. This symposium will focus on all aspects of humanitarian relief operations supported by the novel use of AI technologies from enabling missing persons to be located, leveraging crowdsourced data to provide early warning for rapid response to emergencies, increasing situational awareness, to logistics and supply chain management.

Similarly, healthcare is one of the foremost challenges of today’s world, highlighted by the recent COVID-19 pandemic where it has come to the forefront of the global discourse. Moreover, AI in healthcare is characterized by the last mile problem, where delivering a practical solution that is reliable, robust to errors (especially in “break glass in case of emergency” situations), and graceful degradation has proven hard to implement. These have broader implications in the context of fairness, explainability, and transparency. Therefore, implementation and deployment of AI systems in production in healthcare bring up challenges that go far beyond model building and scoring. This symposium will also focus on a broad range of AI healthcare applications and problems encountered, including but not limited to: automation bias, prescriptive AI models, explainability, privacy and security, transparency, and decision rights, especially in the context of deployment of AI in healthcare.

Special Issue on



Edge-AI for Connected Living



With the digital revolution, edge analytics along with Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an important part of our lives and is getting tremendous attention from industry, academia, governments, and from the smart connected living community as a whole.  The Internet of Things (IoT) has brought the true vision of the connected world into reality with a massive amount of data and numerous services. However, because of the massive connectivity of IoT-connected devices in providing numerous connected living services, it becomes computation intensive and storage burden at each edge device. To address these challenges, edge computing along with AI provides powerful computation services and massive data acquisition at edge networks in an intelligent manner for autonomous decision-making, which is quite impossible for individual human analysts. The edge-AI (edge analytics driven by AI) has the capability to self-learn the data, understand the pattern, optimize, make predictions and providing fresh insights to stakeholders of connected living for better decision with improved Quality of Services (QoS). Even though a very few researchers have been making advances to the study of AI and edge data analytics individually, a very little attention has been given to build a cost-effective Edge-AI driven connected living ecosystem while considering many aspects of its algorithms, communications, offloading, caching, architectures/framework, and services. Still, many technical challenges need to be addressed in this convergence of edge-AI driven connected living paradigm.

The aim of this Special Issue (SI) is to bring academic researchers and industry developers together for sharing the recent advances and future trends of AI-driven edge intelligence for connected living. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following:

•	Explainable AI (XAI) and predictive edge analytics for COVID-19

•	Edge AI-assisted COVID-19 and similar infectious disease detection or diagnosis systems

•	AI-centric Mobile Edge Computing approach for Connected Living

•	AI-enabled IoT-edge data analytics for Connected Living

•	AI-enabled edge data fusion for Connected Living

•	ML-driven driven edge approach to Connected Living

•	AI/Deep Learning/Machine Learning based networked applications, techniques and testbeds for connected Living

•	AI-driven multi access edge computing approach for Connected Living

•	New opportunities, challenges, case studies, and applications of Edge-AI for Connected Living

•	Security, Privacy, and Trust of Edge-AI for Connected Living"

It is widely accepted that better and more affordable healthcare is feasible. Interestingly, many of the reasons for this inefficiency are game theoretic: conflicting objectives, asymmetric information, lack of proper incentives, externalities, and more.



The fields of multi-agent systems and algorithmic game theory combine techniques from both computer science and game theory or micro economics to produce algorithms that take these self-interests into account. Such methodologies can be used to develop computerized solutions that overcome the above problems. Moreover, by incorporating patients' preferences into the algorithms, these solutions can be used to transform health systems to put the interests of patients in center, resulting in better care.

 Call for Papers

------------------------

This workshop will provide a unique and valuable opportunity in which participants will be able to meet, talk, and showcase their visualization techniques to leading physicians and receive feedback about how their tools can be adapted for use in clinical practice. In addition, physicians will provide detailed information about areas in healthcare where additional visualization techniques are needed.



Visualization and visual analytics show great potential as methods to analyze, filter, and illustrate many of the diverse data used in clinical practice. Today, (a) physicians and clinical practitioners are faced with the challenging task of analyzing large amount of unstructured, multi-modal, and longitudinal data to effectively diagnose and monitor the progression of a particular disease; (b) patients are confronted with the difficult task of understanding the correlations between many clinical values relevant to their health; and (c) healthcare organizations are faced with the problem of improving the overall operational efficiency and performance of the institution while maintaining the quality of patient care and safety.



Visualization and visual analytics can potentially provide great benefits to each of these three core areas of healthcare. However, to be successful, the resulting visualization must be able to meet the physician's requirements and be useful for both patients and physicians. 





------------------------------

   Topics and Scope

------------------------------



Topics of interests include but are not limited to: 

   * Visual analysis and exploration of longitudinal clinical test

   * Visual data mining of EHR

   * Visualization of prescriptions drugs and interactions

General Information 



EHST focuses on e-Health services and their related technologies, with a particular stress on the modeling of complex e-Health technology-driven service-provisioning systems. Some fundamental modeling challenges related to e-Health services are to be addressed. In approaching such services though, we are mainly concerned with Tele-Monitoring and Tele-Treatment, as two essential directions of supporting healthcare through advanced technology. By Tele-Monitoring we mean the monitoring of the patient’s condition (including the monitoring of vital signs, such as blood pressure and blood sugar), supported by technology systems. By Tele-Treatment we mean performing some forms of treatment from distance, for example through actuators. 



These research directions essentially concern the Mobility aspect since both Tele-Monitoring and Tele-Treatment are realized from distance, through advanced mobile devices. There are open questions however, concerning the reliability of mobile technology ‘any time any place’, the operation of devices and batteries in ‘real’ conditions, and so on. The mentioned Mobility aspect points as well to the desired capability of (e-Health) systems to adequately react on changes in their environment, referred to as context awareness. We therefore acknowledge that technology-driven healthcare systems could only be really useful if they are context-aware. Finally, even though current technology helps in offering powerful support, providing the patient with complex and constant healthcare services (while keeping him/her in his/her own environment), there are important related concern, such as security and privacy, which need to be addressed also, since providing powerful (remote) support to patients would only make adequate value if patients’ data is treated in a secure and privacy-sensitive way. Last but not least, in order for e-Health services to be succesfully deployed in routine care, the services need to fit the needs of the users and clinical effectiveness should be proven. Reserach dedicated toward user-driven design approaches and validation trials are very welcome to the EHST 2013. 



The goal of EHST is therefore to address the fundamental modeling challenges related to e-Health services and technologies. We believe that this event will contribute to the dissemination of relevant research results, supporting in this way the wider applicability of advanced technology in healthcare.

Book Content Description  



Information is paramount to the world’s economy, particularly in the healthcare sector. This market entails intense data, medical epidemiologic sets, Internet browsing records, surveys, complex engineering models, and so on.

        Technology nowadays makes it easy, inexpensive, and ubiquitous to obtain, observe, and measure several types of variables via the Cloud. This quest for knowledge prompts the data dimensionality, which calls for more sophisticated and efficient information strategies.

        Health science and biology are very complex fields fully embedded in information technology, but the associated processes are much too intricate to be faithfully modeled. It is not easy to extract knowledge starting from raw data, and it is also expensive. 

        Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare (AIH) has been the primary concern to  develop expert systems aimed for diagnostic and decision-making in knowledge acquisition, representation, reasoning, and explanation. 

        Many healthcare facilities (HFs) have data acquisition, monitoring, and storage  systems integrated into larger-scale information systems. This extensive amount of information and databases stemming from medical applications cause hinder analysis and decision making. Hence, there is a need to develop better tools for accessing/storing/analyzing knowledge while effectively using multimodal data. These necessities become essential in the healthcare realm as decision-making relies on knowledge from multidisciplinary areas. This book intends to provide computational methods for intelligent health data analysis to narrow the gap between data gathering and data comprehension with applications in medicine, health care, biology, pharmacology, and related areas. 

          Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA) expedites healthcare analyses and applications. IDA employs specialized statistical, pattern recognition, machine learning (ML), data abstraction, and visualization tools for analysis of data and discovery of mechanisms that created them. Healthcare data typically involve many records/variables, subtle interactions between entities, or a combination of all factors.

         Engineering, computing science, and ML empower data analysis tasks. The IDA  central concept is extracting knowledge from too much data, with a vast amount of variables, data that represents very complex, nonlinear, real-life problems. Moreover, IDA can help to start from the raw data, coping with prediction tasks without knowing  the theoretical description of the underlying process, classification tasks of new events, or modeling unknown processes. Classification, prediction, and modeling are the cornerstones brought in by IDA. 

        This book focuses on AIH methods and tools to bridge data gathering and data comprehension. Emphasis will also be given to problem solving within HFs to handle the analysis of patient records, data warehousing, intelligent alarming, competent monitoring, and so on. In medicine, overcoming this gap is particularly crucial since medical decision-making needs comprehension of healthcare data regularities and trends. This book tackles different IDA approaches from a practical point of view. 

         This edited volume caters to healthcare/biology stakeholders, computer scientists, agronomical specialists, and engineers who work with large amounts of data to extract some knowledge to integrate with previous experience for prediction, classification, or modeling. The practical approach helps to foster innovation and to cope with challenging problems. Graduate and advanced undergraduate courses in engineering, mathematics, medicine, business, administration, or biology can use this book for a new point of view in solving real, practical problems when underlying processes are not transparent.

Example healthcare challenges include behaviour and lifestyle-related diseases, such as obesity, depression, work-related stress, stroke, falls and cardiovascular health issues. A paradigm shift from a reactive towards a proactive model, is of paramount importance for the sustainability of healthcare costs of an ageing population (e.g. in the UK and Japan). In this direction, mobile healthcare sensors manifest a promising engineering approach to the problem. For example a data fusion of environmental and wearable biosensors, such Electrocardiogram (ECG), accelerometer, global positioning (GPS), can help detect medical emergencies such falls and strokes, analyse longer-term illnesses such as depression and anxiety, intervene, e.g. with visualisation-based therapies, or gather more data, e.g. with application-aided mood collection or crowdsourcing.



One enabling technology to healthcare data mining involves centralised (big) data mining. However, continuous and real-time mobile communications of healthcare sensor data are limited by energy (battery) and bandwidth physical constrains. Instead, the aim of this CAMAD 2015 Special Session on Healthcare Data mining in sENSor nEtworks (HealthDENSE) is to advance recent research of sensor-based healthcare data mining.  This involves, in-network activity and behaviour analytics, time-series data mining, and delay-tolerant communications.  The scope of HealthDENSE further extends to knowledge-based network optimisation through sensor data mining. Finally, recent advances on data mining for privacy protection can be adopted and adapted for e-health citizen privacy.



Submission of original and unpublished work in all areas related to HealthDENSE is welcome. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following areas.

* In-network or sensor data mining.

* Time series data fusion.

* Behaviour analytics.

* Distributed symptom detection model for learning and inference.

* Mood and stress-related analytics.

* Anomaly detection in ECG and activity data.

* Healthcare mobile ad hoc network simulation.

* Knowledge-based wireless network optimisation for e-health.

A variety of relevant health and fitness parameters are now being captured via an ecosystem of consumer-oriented wearable self-tracking devices, smartphone apps and related services. Techniques from information science, sociology, psychology, statistics, machine learning and data mining are applied to analyze collected data.



These techniques provide new opportunities to enrich the understanding of individual and population health. Self-tracking data can provide better measures of everyday behaviour and lifestyle and can complement more traditional clinical data collection, towards a comprehensive picture of health.



HealthWear will bring together researchers, developers, designer and industry professionals from both Healthcare community and University to discuss key issues, opportunities and obstacles for personal health data research. These include challenges of capturing, summarizing, presenting and retrieving relevant information from heterogeneous sources to support a new vision of pervasive personal healthcare.

AIM and SCOPE

=============

Medical telereporting and second-opinion over the Internet are nowadays cost-effective and widely adopted practices.

Physicians and general practitioners make daily use of tele-consultation over the WEB, VOIP, chat and video-conferencing. Social networking favors the constitution of large communities of members sharing similar medical interest, so that TeleMedicine is rapidly turning into what we call ""NetMedicine"", which simply denotes every Health-related activity hich is carried on through the Internet.

Since its inception and along all its history, Artificial Intelligence served the Medicine, under both its souls, the logicistic and the connessionistic ones. But in the current digitally networked and hyperlinked e-Health scenario, Artificial Intelligence has to play also new important roles.

Today we urge intelligent software to semantically interpret and filter diagnostic data, automatically classify and convey medical information, virtualize nurses and hospital lanes to reduce the costs of healthcare, etc.

This one-day workshop aims at bringing together scholars and practitioners active in Artificial Intelligence driven Health Informatics, to present and discuss their research, share their knowledge and experiences, define key research challenges and explore possible international collaborations to advance the intelligent practice of Medicine over the Internet.

Introduction

The proportion of elderly people in Western countries is increasing forcing governments to consider strategies to support independent elderly living. Due to this demographic change there has been growing interest in investigating the elderly themselves as active content providers for their own everyday life supporting services. Elderly can, instead of a burden, been seen as resource. The consequence of increasing life expectancy and decreasing birth rates is an EU population that is becoming increasingly older. On the social side of this issue, it is important for all these people having the need to be supported in their daily-life-activities to remain integrated in social life - despite of their age and existing disabilities. On the economical side, ageing has enormous implications, since not only the income side of social schemes is affected but also expenditures: health care systems for instance, are concerned. Facing these challenges of ageing societies there exist areas of opportunity, where technological and social-economic innovation can enhance the quality of life of older and impaired people, mitigate the economic problems of an ageing population and create new economic and business opportunities.



Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) includes assistance to carry out daily activities, health and activity monitoring, enhancing safety and security, getting access to social, medical and emergency systems, and facilitating social contacts. Receiving social and/or medical support in various new intelligent ways consequently contributes to independent living and quality of life for many elderly and disabled people. Overall, AAL can improve the quality of life of elderly people at home and reduces the need of caretakers, personal nursing.



The proposed special issue focuses on Innovative ICT-based Products, Services and Systems for Elderly People



Overall Objectives and Mission

The proposed special issue will provide a compendium of terms, definitions and explanations of concepts, processes and acronyms. Additionally, this issue will feature papers (each paper consists of 6,000-8,000 words) authored by leading experts offering an in-depth description of key terms and concepts related to different areas, issues and trends in Innovative Technologies and Systems for Ambient Assisted Living.



The specific aims are to:



-Foster the emergence of innovative ICT-based products, services and systems for ageing well at home, in the community, and at work, thus increasing the quality of life, autonomy, participation in social life, skills and employability of elderly people, and reducing the costs of health and social care.

-Create a critical mass of research, development and innovation in technologies and services for ageing well in the information society, including the establishment of a favorable environment for participation by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

-Improve conditions for industrial exploitation by providing a coherent European framework for developing common approaches and facilitating the localization and adaptation of common solutions which are compatible with varying social preferences and regulatory aspects at national or regional level.



The concept of Ambient Assisted Living is understood as:



-to extend the time people can live in their preferred environment by increasing their autonomy, self-confidence and mobility;

-to support maintaining health and functional capability of the elderly individuals,

-to promote a better and healthier lifestyle for individuals at risk;

-to enhance the security, to prevent social isolation and to support maintaining the multifunctional network around the individual;

-to support caregivers, families and care organizations;

-to increase the efficiency and productivity of used resources in the ageing societies.



Recommended topics include, but are not limited to, the following:

-Innovative E-Health and Telemedicine Services, Applications and Products

-ICT for the Management and Prevention of Chronic Conditions of Elderly People

-ICT based solutions for Advancement of Social Interaction of Elderly People

-ICT-based Solutions for Advancement of Older Persons’ Independence and Participation in the “Self-Serve Society""

-ICT based solutions for Advancement of Older Persons’ Mobility

Online Social media such as Facebook, Twitter, QuitNet are increasingly being used for health-related purposes. A 2013 online survey suggests that 59.9% patients used Twitter for increasing knowledge and exchanging advice and 52.3% used Facebook for social support and exchanging advice (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23899831).



Novel techniques for information analysis, reuse, and integration are critical to make sense of health-related information. Systematic approaches, design principles, and evaluation strategies need to be researched for developing effective health-related social computing applications. Other challenges in social computing include accommodating privacy, security, and trust expectations of users or separating good information from noise. The aim of this workshop is to discuss and exchange ideas on the issues and challenges in social computing systems as they relate to health care and public health. We invite research or position papers from researchers and practitioners working in any aspect of social computing with research focus on health, healthcare, or public health. Example topics, but not limited to, include:



Design, modeling, and simulation of socially-aware health technology

Demonstration cases of using existing social media platforms (e.g., twitter, facebook) for health research



Social network analysis for the purpose of understanding or intervening upon health related outcomes

Call for Papers:

Journal of Simulation Special Issue on Simulation for Sustainable Healthcare



Web link: 

http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jos/jos_cfp_sush.pdf



Guest Editors:

Navonil Mustafee, University of Exeter (UK)

Korina Katsaliaki, International Hellenic University (Greece)



==================================



The Journal of Simulation (JOS), an official journal of The UK Operational Research Society, aims to publish methodological and technological advances in the application of simulation modelling-related theory and practice. JOS publishes material in a wide range of domains, including manufacturing, service, defence and healthcare, as it seeks to interest and provoke discussion within the wider simulation community. JOS has recently been accepted by Thomson Reuters for indexing and inclusion in the Science Citation Index (SCI). JOS will publish a special issue on simulation for achieving sustainable development in healthcare. The call for paper follows:



The World Commission on Environment and Development (Brundtland Commission) defines sustainable development as the “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"" (WCED, 1987). In the context of sustainable development, the concept of the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) of sustainability is important. TBL refers to the consideration of economic, social and environmental responsibilities with respect to decision making and setting strategic priorities. The focus of this special issue is on simulation for sustainable healthcare. 



There is potential for huge efficiency savings in healthcare through use of computer simulation (Dowler, 2011). However, the scope of systems’ modelling and simulation (M&S), which hitherto focussed predominantly on productivity-related measures, will need to be extended to incorporate sustainability-related criterion since there is a growing awareness among the organisational stakeholders that their success is profoundly dependent on creating a harmony among the TBL of sustainability. 



A cross-industry review of literature on ""modelling for sustainability"" suggests that there has been an unequal treatment of economic, social and the environmental factors in studies employing computer simulation. For example, M&S studies in non-healthcare topics such as sustainable manufacturing and green supply chain have mostly neglected the social factors pertaining to sustainability. However, healthcare is a welfare-oriented citizen-centric service and therefore healthcare modelling cannot ignore the social factors pertaining to sustainability. Further, a review of literature has shown that although the application of simulation in healthcare has dramatically increased over the years, there is arguably a dearth of studies which have considered the TBL of sustainability. Thus, the aim of this special issue is to solicit high quality papers that focus on the holistic and long term view of modelling healthcare systems, with particular emphasis on establishing a harmony between the economic, social and environmental objectives of sustainability. 



The special issue editors invite contributions in conceptual, methodological and technical advances to modelling for sustainability in healthcare. Studies that have applied M&S for practical problem solving and have considered the TBL of sustainability are also welcome. The review process will be the same as that used by the journal. Topics suitable for this special issue include, but are not limited to, the following:

• Cross-domain review of literature pertaining to M&S for sustainability, with the objective of furthering sustainable healthcare simulation.

• Conceptual models and frameworks to guide the development of models for sustainable healthcare. Empirical validation of the same.

• Methodological aspects pertaining to modelling for sustainability, for example, the use of hybrid simulation models that incorporate both productivity and sustainability–related criterion.

• Studies that report on the application of simulation for sustainable dementia care, sustainable care for the elderly, among others.

• Sustainable healthcare supply chains.

• Studies that increase awareness of sustainable healthcare through use of Serious Games in a teaching environment.



------



Submission Site and Important Dates:

•	All manuscripts should be submitted using the JOS online paper submission system (selecting “Sustainable Healthcare” in the special issue drop down box) at http://jos.msubmit.net/cgi-bin/main.plex.

•	Please check and follow the JOS formatting guidelines carefully before submitting: http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jos/author_instructions.html

CALL FOR PAPERS



RATIONALE



Artificial Intelligence in Medicine is facing a new challenge, created by the rapid growth in information science and technology in general and the complexity and volume of data in particular. Medical settings are using sensors and networks of health information systems to integrate data from patients from which it is necessary to extract some sort of knowledge. The main issue is that this data production often takes the form of high-speed continuous flows of data.



Medical domains include several settings where data is produced in a streaming fashion, such as anatomical and physiological sensors, or incidence records and health information systems. New services like Google Health appear allowing users to store and track information about their medical history, to connect to and stream data from medical devices. Medical data streams become widespread and call for development of intelligent tool for making use of these data. Decision support, alerting services, ambient intelligence, assisted leaving and personalization services are just few examples of expected uses of actionable knowledge extracted from medical data streams. All of them are characterized by the high-speed at which huge amounts of data are produced, and often require fast and accurate information retrieval and analysis, that can effectively support clinical decisions.



Dealing with continuous, and possibly infinite, flows of data require different approaches for machine learning and knowledge discovery. Particular issues to address include summarization of infinite data, incremental and decremental learning, resource-awareness, real-time monitoring of changes and recurrences, etc. This is an incremental task that requires incremental learning algorithms that integrate artificial intelligence in medical domains. Streaming artificial intelligence is increasingly important in the research community, as new algorithms are needed to process medical data in reasonable time.



Furthermore, medical domains introduce extra peculiarities to the learning problem. For example, health information systems now deal with heterogeneous data sources, possibly distributed across healthcare institutions. Moreover, this data integration requirement yields possibly privacy-preserving issues, the same time it forces the system to take time, resources, and costs into consideration.



Currently, generic techniques for intelligent analysis and learning from streaming data are widely spread in the machine learning research community. Also, in the medical domain technological issues of data collection and storage, access, integration, information fusion, etc are also widely studied in the health informatics research community. However, adoption and development of tailored techniques for medical stream mining and clinical decision support is still to come.



The goal of this workshop is to bring together experts in data stream mining interested in medical applications and medical domain experts interested in timely analysis of their data streams for clinical decision support.

Special Issue on Observational Healthcare Data



Guest Editors: Patrick Ryan, J&J and Marc Suchard, UCLA



Due date: July 1, 2013



Data sciences is the rapidly evolving field that integrates

mathematical and statistical knowledge, software engineering and

large-scale data management skills, and domain expertise to tackle

difficult problems that typically cannot be solved by any one

discipline alone.  Some of the most difficult, and arguably most

important, problems exist in healthcare.  Knowledge about human

biology has exponentially advanced in the past two decades with

exciting progress in genetics, biophysics, and pharmacology.  However,

substantial opportunities exist to extend the evidence base about

human disease, patient health and effects of medical interventions and

translate knowledge into actions that can directly impact clinical

care.  The emerging availability of 'big data' in healthcare, ranging

from prospective research with aggregated genomics and clinical trials

to observational data from administrative claims and electronic health

records through social media, offer unprecedented opportunities for

data scientists to contribute to advancing healthcare through the

development, evaluation, and application of novel analytical solutions

to explore these data to generate evidence at both the patient and

population level.  Statistical and computational challenges abound and

methodological progress will draw on fields such as data mining,

epidemiology, medical informatics, and biostatistics to name but a

few.  This special issue of Statistical Analysis and Data Mining seeks

to capture the current state of the art in healthcare data sciences.

We welcome contributions that focus on methodology for healthcare data

and original research that demonstrates the application of data

sciences to problems in public health."

Special Session: Ambient Intelligence and Assisted Living 



(at IFSA-EUSFLAT 2015, Gijon, Spain, http://www.softcomputing.es/ifsa-eusflat2015/) 



Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is an emerging discipline that utilises the advances in sensors and sensor networks, Pervasive Computing and Artificial Intelligence, to create intelligent environments that improve the quality of life of their inhabitants. These environments are capable of monitoring user activities, supporting and proactively adapting themselves to user needs, helping with their daily routines, etc., in an unobtrusive and invisible way. AmI systems rely on computational devices (sensors, actuators, mobile devices, etc.), which supports the context awareness required for the personalized services. 

Since Ambient Intelligence applications are developed for the real-world, the efficient processing of the uncertainty inherently related to AmI environments is crucial. In that way, fuzzy techniques emerge as a main requirement in any Ambient Intelligence application. Fuzzy techniques could help to manage information from different sources and provide higher-processing information, reducing the redundant and anomalous information, avoiding errors in the inferred knowledge and facilitating user assistance. 



Topics:

- Ambient Intelligence Services or Applications

- Healthcare information processing

- Ambient Assisted Living Applications

- Fuzzy based-systems for Ambient Intelligent

- Prediction of User behaviour

- Time series processing

- Situational/Context Awareness services

- Interaction with the smart home (wearable, gesture recognition, affective computing)

- Activity of daily living (ADL) monitoring and recognition

- E-health services and applications

They create their own palliative impulse by converting a fusion of detachment and rhetorical invention into an appropriately purposeful message.



What is the nature of such communication? How should such communication (1) provide relief from pain and other distressing symptoms, (2) affirm life, (3) regard dying as a normal process, (4) integrate psychological and spiritual aspects of patient care, (5) contribute to helping patients live as actively as possible until death, (6) contribute to helping the family cope during the patient’s illness and in their own bereavement, (7) use a team approach to address the needs of patients and their families, including bereavement counseling, if implicit, and (8) enhance quality of life, possibly influencing the course of illness?



This symposium, designed to facilitate interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to the many and varied issues germane to these issues, aims to cover as wide a range of viewpoints as possible from among experienced practitioners and theoreticians alike.



All interested in participating are invited to submit, upon thoughtful consideration of the points enumerated above, a 250-word Abstract, .pdf formatted, in response to any one of them, no later than February 1, 2016, to the Submissions Editor.

DESCRIPTION:

Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise to improve our healthcare systems. Current AI-based systems already support drug development, triage, screening, diagnosis, and patient follow-up; and the potential is to completely reconfigure the way our healthcare systems work. In the face of such strong potential, many scientists have devoted their research to the development of AI-based systems, and PubMed has seen a tenfold increase in the number of publications mentioning AI, in the past two years alone. Nevertheless, and despite the strong optimism, few AI-based systems have been integrated in everyday care. 



Going the “last mile” with AI-based systems will require not only robust algorithms, but also dealing with implementation challenges and guaranteeing that AI-based system fit the needs and practices of patients, carers, clinicians, and clinical researchers. In other words, we need Human-Computer Interaction and a Human-Centred perspective to help unleash the AI potential in healthcare. 



The HCI community has often been seen as contributing at the margins of the creation of AI-based systems for healthcare. As the majority of research studies focused on demonstrating technical feasibility and performance of algorithms, they could draw on retrospective datasets and refrain from involving users. However, as AI-based systems start to integrate healthcare systems, there is a pressing need for exploring questions related to: i) What constitutes Human-Centred AI in healthcare? ii) How to design AI-based interactive systems for healthcare? and iii) How to deploy and evaluate AI-based systems in practice and what are the sociotechnical and ethical implications for the human end-users? 



Guiding the next generation of HCI work on AI for healthcare are the contributions of the community to Explainable AI, as well as the studies on accountability, transparency, fairness, and ethics. The few ethnographic studies describing AI-based systems use in practice will also be useful in illuminating the assessment of these type of solutions in context. Still, important work is yet to come as designing Human-AI interactions is extremely complex due to the variety of workflows triggered by different datasets, the current lack of iterative prototyping tools, and the difficulties of communicating AI capabilities to the design team. 





TOPICS OF INTEREST:

* Ethnographies that unpack the use, appropriation, and other sociotechnical aspects of AI-based systems in healthcare, in self-care, clinical care, or clinical research; 

* Expectations, perspectives, and misalignments between users and developers; 

* Theoretical discussions of key concepts appearing in the Human-Centred AI literature for healthcare, including explainable AI, accountable AI, as well as fairness or ethics in AI; 

* Theoretical discussions (re-)visiting key HCI concepts in the space, including patient-clinician interaction, shared decision-making, or self-care; 

* Applications and designs that explore and advance Human-Centred AI in healthcare; 

* Methodologies, methods, approaches, or adaptations needed for creating appropriate human-AI interactive systems; 

* Reviews of existing research on the design, integration, and/or evaluation of ML and AI technology in healthcare. 





IMPORTANT DATES:

* Full paper submission deadline: October 29th, 2021

*Evolving Intelligent Systems in Healthcare to Aid Resource-Poor Communities*



- Call for papers:

This Issue is now open for submissions and papers are published upon acceptance, regardless of the Special Issue publication date.



- Description:

The limited number of skilled healthcare providers to deliver healthcare services in resource-poor settings is definitely affecting population health. Most of the time, residents in resource-poor settings in developing countries are unable to enjoy the benefit of the advanced medical diagnostic tests and treatment facilities that are available in urban regions. This limitation tends to have a negative impact on the patient’s health, and the delay in treatment might endanger the life of a patient. Thus, an intelligent medical/healthcare information system such as early diagnosis of medical conditions helps resource-poor communities to identify the possible disease earlier and to increase their awareness of health conditions.



Evolutionary algorithms have been around for a long time. These algorithms have been used to solve specific problems conventionally. The solutions that perform best on some metrics are obtained in each generation. These algorithms have achieved some successes, and they can be more computationally intensive than other approaches such as deep learning, which has exploded in popularity in recent years. Instead of optimizing for a specific goal, it embraces a creative exploration of all possible solutions. By doing so, it has paid off with ground-breaking results. Biological evolution is also the only system to produce human intelligence, which is the ultimate goal of many AI researchers. Healthcare/medical fields need a diagnostics system with good accuracy that provides quick results. The evolutionary algorithms have the potential to improve existing healthcare systems, especially the ones that assist resource-poor setting communities.



This Special Issue aims to gather original research articles and review articles that cover the challenges and applications of evolving intelligent systems, including analysis, techniques, and applications. Thus, research that explores novel applications of evolving intelligent systems are particularly encouraged. Although this Special Issue considers a wide range of evolving intelligent systems topics, submissions should be focused primarily on systems that benefit resource-poor communities.



Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:



- Intelligent recommender systems for healthcare authorities in resource-poor communities based on the concept of Evolving in Dynamic Environments

- Self-monitoring evolving systems to trace the spread of epidemic diseases in rural areas

- Neural networks with evolving structure for mobile app healthcare systems to aid medical staff in resource-poor communities

- Automatic novelty detection in evolving systems applied to early diagnosis of medical conditions to aid resource-poor communities

- Evolving intelligent systems in time series prediction with applications to predict the spread of epidemic diseases in rural areas

- Evolving intelligent systems, rural area outpatient monitoring system based on evolving behaviour models

- Evolving Fuzzy Clustering Methods and Fuzzy Rule-based Classifiers for diagnosing common diseases in resource-poor communities

- Evolving Fuzzy Decision Support-based mobile expert system for medical diagnosis of common diseases in resource-poor communities

 : Mobility and Health Symposium: Innovations, Usages, Perspectives
 


=================================== =======
 


September 1, 2011, Ax les Thermes - Ariège (09) - France
 
as part of the Ludovia 2011 scientific conference
 


website: http://sites.google.com/site/sms2011ludovia/
 


==== ======================================
 


Recent advances in the field of sensor networks, communications wireless,
 
information systems, man-machine interfaces and taking into account the context
 
find natural outlets in the field of application of e-health, such as
 
tele-medicine, aid to autonomy, home support for the patient or hospitalization

at home for example. 



However, many technological hurdles, and social scientists have yet to 
 
stand before these innovations can not be implemented effectively within the
 
health system, with the aim to contribute to improving the quality of life of
 
the health and autonomy. These obstacles are mainly located at the interface
 
between the specialties concerned: medicine, IT, sociology, economics,
 
ethics and law must be mobilized to design the e-health systems of tomorrow
 
so that they take into account the mobility of patients, information, equipment

medical and nursing staff. Particular attention must also be paid to
 
the social acceptability and usability of these new systems by patients and the
 
staff for whom they are intended.



To remove these obstacles, however, it is not enough to juxtapose scientific 
and technical skills
 . Alternative methods are possible, such as 
collaborative multidisciplinary design
 bringing together designers and actors concerned by the e-health system. These methods
 
can make it possible to find a larger panel of better adapted solutions and to reach a
 
more satisfactory and robust compromise.



As part of the 7th edition of the Ludovia scientific conference, a specific symposium

is planned around the theme of digital mobility and e-health. This symposium is intended to
 
be a place of exchange where researchers from different communities, and in particular young
 
researchers, can present the results of their work.

It is also an opportunity to confront contradictory points of view and to initiate new
 
collaborations.





Non-exhaustive list of topics covered:
 
==========================================
 


* Health in mobility, mobility of patients and caregivers
 
* Context-sensitive applications for health
 
* Serious games for e-health
 
* Mobile networks for health

The world's pressing healthcare needs may benefit from judicious application of networked information technology. Future networked information systems will support, for example, clinical workflow, remote diagnosis and consultation, e-prescribing, and mobile data collection and surveillance, disease outbreak identification and patient participation in their own wellbeing and care. Mobile-computing technology may be particularly helpful in improving access to healthcare (geography, monetary and informational), by encouraging personal health management, and by enabling patient and provider mobility. Wearable medical devices are emerging, to measure essential vital signs like pulse, respiration, ECG, blood glucose level, and patient mobility. Handheld devices support clinicians in urban hospitals, and portable diagnostic kits allow remote healthcare teams to more easily reach rural villages.



The widespread availability of mobile phones, and recent experiments with low-cost, long-range broadband wireless networks, bring connectivity to all these opportunities. We encourage papers that present novel ideas for networked computing technology in support of healthcare, and which are likely to invoke thoughtful discussion at the workshop.



Research papers should focus on all aspects of networked healthcare technologies. Of interest, though not exclusively, are the following topics:

remote diagnosis and remote consultation

clinical applications of mobile or networked healthcare

mobile and wearable medical sensing applications

design of wearable and home-care health devices

sensor networks for public health monitoring and surveillance

networked mobile technology for rural healthcare

security and privacy in healthcare application

experience from technology deployments

usability of mobile health applications and devices

applications to emergency response and disaster response

cost-efficient and energy-efficient networking for remote healthcare

remote access to electronic health records



Papers should be limited to 6 pages in IEEE format, not submitted concurrently elsewhere in any form, and present new contributions regarding either technology or experience in deploying technology. Papers should be submitted via EDAS.



The workshop will also include a poster session, where researchers are encouraged to present work-in-progress on any of the topics above. Posters regarding experience with NetHealth or mHealth prototypes or pilot deployments are particularly encouraged. To be considered for the session, please submit a 1-page abstract in IEEE format according to the deadlines below. Instructions for poster preparation will be sent to accepted authors.

Scope 



Pervasive Health is a premier international forum with a specific focus on technologies and human factors related to the use of ubiquitous computing in healthcare and for wellbeing. The overall goal of the Pervasive Health conference is to take a multidisciplinary approach to Pervasive Healthcare, technology, research and development.



Pervasive Health is addressing a broad scope of research topics and concerns: identify and understand problems from a technological, social, medical, and legal as well as financial perspective (with a particular emphasis on understanding and supporting patient and practitioner needs), design, implementation, and evaluation of supporting hardware and software infrastructures, algorithms, services and applications, and organizational strategies that facilitate integration of Pervasive Healthcare technology into the healthcare enterprise.



Traditional healthcare environments are extremely complex and challenging to manage, as they need to cope with an assortment of patient conditions under various circumstances with a number of resource constraints. Pervasive Healthcare technologies seek to respond to a variety of these pressures by successfully integrating them within existing healthcare environments.



It is essential that Pervasive Healthcare environments, through a combined approach of data collection, data correlation and data presentation, assist healthcare professionals in delivering high levels of patient care, and empower individuals and their families for self-care and health management.



Pervasive Health aims to gather technology experts, practitioners, industry and international authorities contributing towards the assessment, development and deployment of pervasive medical based technologies, standards and procedures.



The year of 2020 was challenging in all dimensions of Pervasive Health. Traditional ways of monitoring, diagnosing, treating and communicating/relationships between healthcare providers, patients and their families/caregivers changed dramatically, at once, and challenged the healthcare sector, industry and decision-makers. The challenges were clinical, technological, legal and social. Furthermore, the covid-19 pandemic brought some opportunities and the new technologies developed/adapted for care as well as new care models are here to stay.



Looking forward we need to understand which care models and technologies should be implemented in current\future care and how can we implement the technologies and combine them with the “human factor” to yield the best results for future healthcare.



The Pervasive Health conference this year will focus on lessons learned from the last year (of Covid-19), new technologies designed and developed to face the challenges, and the way healthcare systems should be re-designed in collaboration with the industry, academia and decision-makers to create advanced care systems.

THE FEDERATED CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS

FedCSIS - 2011

Szczecin, Poland, 19-21 September, 2011

Description

According to a 2009 report published by the World Health Organization, ""Globally in 2006, expenditure on health was about 8.7% of gross domestic product, with the highest level in the Americas at 12.8% and the lowest in the South-East Asia Region at 3.4%. This translates to about US$716 per capita on the average but there is tremendous variation ranging from a very low US$31 per capita in the South-East Asia Region to a high of US$2636 per capita in the Americas"" (www.who.int/whosis/whostat/EN\_WHS09\_Table7.pdf(http://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/EN/_WHS09/_Table7.pdf)).



Spending on healthcare systems worldwide continues to surge in spite of the limited number of funding bodies besides governments. These systems have to include state of the art technologies and equipments to keep up the pace with the demands of a growing population and address the risks that diseases put on the welfare of this population. The rapid widespread of some diseases and scarcity of appropriate medical facilities in some countries are examples of challenges that healthcare stakeholders face daily. In addition the lack of a common healthcare systems interoperability framework undermines regularly the efforts put into offering better services that spread over multiple stakeholders. These systems are simply not meant to collaborate making any cross-system scenario tedious and error prone.



Aims and topics

This workshop aims at gathering researchers from the fields of IT and healthcare to think about the obstacles that hurdle the leveraging of interoperable IT healthcare applications. We target researchers from both industry and academia to join forces in this new area. We intend to discuss the recent and significant developments in the general area of healthcare systems. In particular, we hope to identify techniques from IT like service and ubiquitous l computing that will have the greatest impact on making healthcare systems collaborate.

Specific possible topics include (but not limited to) :



  *   Service computing for interoperable healthcare systems

  *   Agent computing for interoperable healthcare systems

  *   Pervasive computing for interoperable healthcare systems

  *   Standards for interoperable healthcare systems

  *   Methods for healthcare systems design

  *   Semantic technologies for healthcare systems

  *   Privacy and security in healthcare systems

  *   Mobile healthcare systems

  *   Context management for healthcare systems

  *   Protection of individual privacy for aggregate anonymous data

  *   Healthcare security and privacy policies

  *   Artificial intelligence technologies to support complex decision making in healthcare systems

  *   Case studies

MICCAI 2019 Workshop on

Clinical Image-based Procedures: Towards Holistic Patient Models for Personalised Healthcare





October 17, 2019

Shenzhen, China



Website:http://miccai-clip.org/

==============================

==========================================



SCOPE



CLIP is about the effective translation of computational image-based techniques into the clinic filling the gaps between medical imaging, basic science and clinical applications. As it nowadays becomes more and more important for many clinical applications to base decisions not only on image data alone, a focus of CLIP 2019 is on the creation of holistic patient models. Here, image data such as radiologic images, microscopy images, and photographs is combined with non-image information such as ‘omics’ data (e.g. genomics, proteomics), life style data, demographics, EEG, and other to build a more complete picture of the individual patient and to subsequently provide better diagnosis and therapies.



CLIP 2019 provides a forum for work centered on specific clinical applications, including techniques and procedures based on comprehensive clinical image and other data. Submissions related to applications already in use and evaluated by clinical users are particularly encouraged. We explicitly welcome novel techniques and applications that are looking at combining image analysis with clinical data mining and analytics, user studies, and other heterogeneous data.





TOPICS





* Combination of image analysis with other heterogeneous data including radiography images, microscopy, photographs, genomics, proteomics, life style data, EEG, bio-data, and other

* Multimodal image integration for modeling, planning and guidance

* Strategies for patient-specific and anatomical modeling to support planning and interventions

* Clinical studies employing advanced image-guided methods

* Clinical translation and validation of image-guided systems

* Current challenges and emerging techniques in image-based procedures

* Clinical applications in open and minimally invasive procedures





PAPER SUBMISSION



Papers can be up to 10 pages. All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 members of the program committee. Reviewing is double-blind so authors have to prepare their manuscripts such that their identity cannot be derived from their submission. The selection of papers will be based on the significance of results, novelty, technical merit, relevance and clarity of presentation.



Electronic paper proceedings will be arranged. The papers will be published in a Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) proceeding. LNCS is indexed by Scopus, ACM Digital Library, DBLP, Conference Proceedings Citation Index (part of Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science), and others.



WORKSHOP FORMAT



Papers will be presented in a day long single track workshop starting with plenary sessions. The final program will consist of previously unpublished and contributed papers with substantial time allocated to discussion. A poster session will accommodate further discussion on new ideas. 



IMPORTANT DATES



* July 22, 2019: Paper submission due date

* August 1, 2019: Notification of acceptance

* tbd: Final camera-ready paper submission deadline

International Workshop on Interactivity in Healthcare (IHS15)

http://interact.computing.dundee.ac.uk 

Held in conjunction with the 15th IFIP TC.13 International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction - INTERACT 2015, Bamberg, Germany, 15th September 2015

 

--------

Motivation and Goals

--------

We are all living longer with average life expectancy increasing across the globe. However, chronic conditions coupled with an increasing global obesity problem still cause a huge strain on healthcare provision and quality of life for patients.



There are two approaches to reduce the burden on healthcare services – encouraging healthy lifestyles through increased knowledge, and improving people’s ability to affect the quality of care for those living with long-term conditions and age related illnesses. Although these issues appear to be separate, they have an effect on each other. We have now reached a critical point in healthcare - both healthcare professionals and patients alike recognize the potential for technology to provide them with personalized healthcare and support. Key goals in this field are to facilitate personalized health information to promote self-management, to identify and act upon support needs, to improve communication between patients and healthcare workers, to assist with the use of medicine and assistive technology and inform decision making between healthcare workers. Additionally, any health technology has to be designed to be usable, efficient, effective and accepted by the healthcare community. This workshop aims to promote discussion between multidisciplinary researchers on novel, innovative and connective approaches within eHealth, improving engagement and patient outcomes.



--------

Topics of interest

--------

This workshop is aimed at multidisciplinary researchers and healthcare professionals from all areas interested in novel approaches to interactivity in technology for healthy living, healthcare and eHealth. The areas of interest are, but not limited to:



- Usability of eHealth technologies

- Technologies to support health education, promotion and advice, and healthy independent living

- Personal health technologies or personalized assistance

- Social Care

- Novel approaches to health technologies

- Tailored decision support (for patients and practitioners)

- Mobile and wearable healthcare systems for eHealth

- Personalization in online support for health and wellbeing

-----------

Submissions

-----------

The workshop welcomes position papers (4 pages), and long papers (up to 10 pages in length). Accepted papers will be published in the official adjunct proceedings of the INTERACT conference, published by the University of Bamberg Press, including ISBN and will be distributed in both on- and offline archival formats. We welcome submissions from multidisciplinary perspectives, as well as PhD students or those new to the field.



For full details on the submission format and procedure, please refer to the Submission Instructions on http://interact.computing.dundee.ac.uk/. Papers will be selected based on originality, quality, and ability to promote discussion.

Call for Papers

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders of the aging human brain, clinically presenting with early memory deficit and progressive cognitive and functional disorientation. In the early stages memory loss is mild, but with late-stage AD individuals lose the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to their environment. Therefore, the healthcare needs for individuals affected with the disease vary as they progress from mild cognitive decline to severe cognitive impairment.

 The brain has 100 billion nerve cells (neurons) and each nerve cell connects with many others to form communication networks. Two abnormal structures called plaques and tangles are prime suspects in damaging and killing nerve cells. 

•	 Plaques are deposits of a protein fragment called beta-amyloid that build up in the spaces between nerve cells. 

•	 Tangles are twisted fibers of another protein called tau that build up inside cells. 

Though most people develop some plaques and tangles as they age, those with AD tend to develop far more. They also tend to develop them in a predictable pattern, beginning in areas important for memory before spreading to other regions. Scientists have not yet determined the specific role of plaques and tangles in AD. Most experts believe they play a critical role in blocking communication between nerve cells and hence, disrupt processes that cells need to survive. 

Currently, there is no cure for AD. Many biomarkers have been developed in order to diagnose and predict progression of the disease. So far, most of them do not provide consistent results. The research is still at an early stage and hence cannot provide objective and reliable measures of disease progression in order to begin early available therapies or to prepare the families and social environment prepare for their care process.

 

It is known that people with AD cannot carry out normal activities and require 24/7 care. The financial burden of this care-process is a threat to the economy of any country. A major effort is underway by pharmaceutical companies to develop disease-modifying therapeutics based on the known pathophysiologic mechanisms of AD and a number of strategies for disease prevention are under investigation as well. 

This workshop will be open to research studies on identifying challenges and providing solutions to combat the disease. Research include topics in deriving integrated markers from multimodal data such as clinical, MRI and PET imaging, and bioinformatics in the clinical field, smart monitoring and assistive technologies in the home and healthcare process, tools for early diagnosis and related areas all welcome.

Papers describing original research on both theoretical and practical aspects in the use of healthcare technologies in the care of the disease are solicited for this workshop. Success stories are also welcome to be shared in this platform.

 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following: 

•Tools for early diagnosis

•Advances in the diagnostic process

•AD care technologies

•AD cloud

•Genome-Phenome-Behaviour (GePheBe) patterns

•GePheBe based simulation models for MCI/AD healthcare

•Nonintrusive behaviour monitoring with wireless sensor network

However, a big majority of such partnerships do not succeed and terminate with little or no benefits to either party. This conference will shed light on industrial engineering techniques and practices that may help organizations and universities in their quest to build successful university – industry alliances.



The Global Joint Conference on Industrial Engineering and Its Application Areas (GJCIE) 2016 is composed of three co-located conferences: the 1st Global Conference on Industrial Engineering (GCIE), the 3rd Global Conference on Engineering and Technology Management (GCETM), and the 2nd Global Conference on Healthcare Systems Engineering and Management (GCHSEM). The GGJCIE 2016 will be an internationally renowned forum for researchers, practitioners, and educators to present and discuss the most recent innovations, trends, experiences, and challenges in the field of industrial engineering. It will bring together experts from academia and industry to exchange the latest research results and trends, and their practical applications in the aforementioned areas of industrial engineering. This will be accomplished through the following three modes of communication: keynote presentations, parallel sessions, and poster sessions.



The GJCIE 2016 will take place from July 14th to July 15th at the Elite World Istanbul Hotel in Istanbul, Turkey. Istanbul is the only city in the world built on two continents. Its rich history has given it a multitude of museums, historical buildings and mosques, Byzantine churches and Roman aqueducts. This exciting venue is alive with the hustle and bustle of business and trade which for centuries has made it a vital trading hub between east and west. Straddling Europe and Asia, Istanbul is the largest and most monumental city in Turkey. It is a melting pot of cultures which mix harmoniously on both sides of a city that is split geographically by the Bosphorus strait. This bustling city is home to over 13 million people and from 14 to 15 July 2016 will also be home to the GJCIE 2016."

CALL FOR PAPERS



[Scope]



The third edition of MobiHealth proposes to continue and extend the focus areas of the first two. The essence of the conference lies in its interdisciplinary nature, with original contributions cutting across boundaries but all within the ambit of the application of mobile communications (technologies, standards, solutions, methodologies, …) to the betterment of human health.

As such, the conference will have a multi-tier approach: going from in-body sensor devices to ubiquitous patient monitoring environments.



[Topics]



The main themes will include (but are not limited to): 



- Advances in sensor devices for biomedical monitoring; 

- Intra-body communication issues (propagation & transmission); 

- Body Area networks (architectures, protocols, scheduling, …);

- Heterogeneous and in-/on-/out- networks; 

- Wearable, outdoor and home-based applications; 

- Data collection and management at hubs, mobile devices and gateways; 

- Energy management and optimisation issues in biomedical devices and networks; 

- Decision support algorithms for data analysis; 

- Healthcare telemetry and telemedicine; 

- Remote diagnosis and patient management; 

- Accuracy, reliability, security, protection, identity, privacy, of diagnoses and data; 

- All-pervasive wireless systems for health applications; 

- Factoring in the environment (hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living, …).



[Keynote addresses]



Keynote addresses: Three keynotes will cover the varied interests of the participants. They will be given by leading experts from industry, standardization and public authorities:

- “Electronics systems for biomedical” 

- “The present and future of body-area networks”

- “Putting the patient at the centre of the process”



[Workshops]

 

Two workshops are proposed:

- “Making the ambient environment count in the diagnostic process”. Intelligent home space where the physical condition of the patient is gleamed from environment sensors (fall, humidity, …) rather than sensors that measure only physiological parameters of the patient. Advantage: Increased fidelity of the diagnosis; less intrusive and cumbersome elements.

- Combining in- on- and off-“. This will deal with an important issue: the combination of several in-, on- and out-body sensors that make up a diagnosis platform.

The two topics mentioned above could potentially attract researchers in several areas thanks to the multidisciplinary approach inherent to them: diagnosis, security, medical service platforms, medical database management, … for the first; propagation in and around the human body, wireless communication, body area network management, … for the second.



[Tutorial

 

Tutorial: The special focus of this conference is “health for the poor”. This is driven by the need to understand and explore how technology can become an enabling factor rather than a hindrance to the delivery of health services to these populations. Any viable e-Health or biomedical solution to this scenario has to satisfy the dual conditions of low cost and ease of utilization.



[Publications]



The Proceedings of Mobihealth 2012 will be published in LNICST, appear in SpringerLink and will be referenced in ICST's digital library, the European Union Digital Library (EUDL).



[Special issue]



Selected papers will be recommended for publication IEEE’s Transactions on Biomedical Electronics journal. 



[Paper submission]



Submission: Authors are invited to submit papers in the format defined by the Springer LNICST Authors' Kit. Regular papers and invited papers are allowed up to 8 pages including all figures, tables and references. Up to 2 extra pages may be included at an additional charge. Details on the submission: http://mobihealth.name/show/authors-kit.

Healthcare systems are overburdened by lack of personnel, budget constraints, emergency, exceptional events, and age-related chronic diseases. The innovation of health services, infrastructures, and processes are compelling, as even more manifested by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. From this perspective, AI methods and techniques are required (and expected) to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and the quality of healthcare systems and their processes. Existing challenges are both in terms of healthcare and also economic.



Cognitive agents (e.g. digital assistants, cognitive twins, chatbots etc.), autonomous agents and humanoid robots are among the most impacting research fields in artificial intelligence, which have proven to be essential for the digitalization of healthcare. For example, robots are increasingly required to play an active role in helping the patients and the medical doctors in the execution of rehabilitation and the explanation of therapy protocols. Similarly, cognitive agents are asked to assist the patients in doing cognitive exercises, checking their health-related pathology status and eventually alerting the doctors when some problematic issues should eventually emerge by providing a preliminary diagnosis of the patient status. Specific topics such as aging, active living, chronic diseases, or others related to the quality of life play an increasingly important role in this research field.



This Research Topic calls for research discussing techniques, problems, challenges, and applications of cognitive agents and robotics in healthcare scenarios.



Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):



• Clinical agent-based decision- support systems, including recommender systems

• Conversational agents and personal digital assistants for patient empowerment

Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought the vision of a smarter world into reality with a massive amount of data and numerous services. However, because of the massive connectivity of IoT-connected devices in providing numerous connected health services, it becomes a computation-intensive and storage burden at each edge device. To address this challenge, edge computing along with AI provides powerful computation services and massive data acquisition at edge networks in an intelligent manner for autonomous decision-making, which is quite impossible for individual human analysts. The edge-IoT services can provide a high quality of experience to physicians, clinics, and other caregivers anytime and from anywhere seamlessly. Similarly, with the outbreak of COVID-19, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained significant attention by utilizing its machine learning algorithms for quality patient care. However, the convergence of Edge, IoT, and AI can provide new opportunities for both technologies, as it can play a significant role in smart healthcare by offering a better insight into healthcare data to support affordable personalized care.



This workshop aims to report high-quality research on recent advances in various aspects of smart connected health, more specifically to the state-of-the-art approaches, methodologies and systems in the design, development, deployment and innovative use of networked services, tools and technologies for smart connected health.
