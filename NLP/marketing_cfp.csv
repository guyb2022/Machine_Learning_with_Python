interdisciplinary issue on IT-related service. Much of the radical transformation of the world economy from an industrial to a

post-industrial service society comes from the contribution of

information technology (IT) to service sectors and from IT as

service. This special issue is multidisciplinary in nature as

many disciplines play a role in the service economy. We invite

scholars from marketing, information systems, operations management, human resources, finance/accounting, economics,

and organizational research to submit papers on IT-related service. We are particularly interested in papers that consider the

productivity and quality of IT-related service and focus on the

relationship with customers (including B2C, B2B and C2C), in

contrast to technology-centered approaches to service management and business interaction. Papers that include empirical,

analytical, and conceptual approaches that develop or extend

theory are welcome. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

 IT’s role in providing cost-effective service

 IT mediated or supported self-service

 IT-related service productivity, quality, and customer

satisfaction

 IT servitization

 IT-related service innovations and business transformation

 IT-related service management and marketing

 IT-related service value networks

 IT service, customer service, and service satisfaction

 IT-related service and consumer behavior

 IT-related service and employee attitudes and behavior

 IT-related service economics and pricing

 IT-related service engineering, systems, and computing

We expect this special issue to lead to significant crossfertilization across fields and, therefore, to particularly high

impact for the papers. The issue is sponsored by the National

Science Council of Taiwan and the Center for Excellence in

Service at the University of Maryland.

The best paper will receive a first-place award of $2,000,

and up to three additional papers will receive honorablemention awards of $1,000 each. In addition, each award will

include an invitation for the paper to be presented at the

Frontiers in Service Conference in 2013 (with complimentary

registration) that will coincide with the publication of the

special issue.

Indeed, at a time when financial problems persist, we need to foster real economy  to underpin the recovery of economic growth. To this aim it is pivotal to find new ways to strengthen the innovation management capacity for SMEs and to increase their value for stakeholders by enhancing company-centric and market-driven approaches. Therefore business research needs to find new tools able to better fit the  needs of internationally oriented SMEs that can help them to implement high-risk and high-potential innovation ideas. 

SMEs must find new ways to think and act towards changes in how production, processes, services and marketing is managed at the international level. 

Among SMEs, family firms contribute significantly to improved living standards, and create a significant level of social, human and financial capital.   

In this scenario this International Workshop aims to address the global economic and social challenges  regarding all aspects of SMEs, shedding the light to the several systemic interactions between natural social and economic systems.

We call for both technical and practical contributions that can represent advancements in the theory and practice for SMEs management, marketing and innovation strategies. 

The International Workshop is open to all the scientific approaches in order to foster constructive debates and confrontations to create new perspective of research and practice in the field of SMEs.   

The submission of research abstracts can cover various fields, among which:   Marketing, Finance, Organizational systems, Family business, Business Ecosystems, Knowledge Management, Stakeholders management, business Innovation, Human Resource Management, Corporate Social Responsibility, Business Sustainability.

Please feel free to download and distribute the call for papers. The deadline for submission of abstracts is 1 July 2010.

http://www.insis.ox.ac.uk/news/Documents/InSIS_Neurosociety_Call_for_Papers.pdf



Topic:

The topic of the conference is the rise of the brain and the emergence of the brain industry or ‘neuro markets’. The aim is to explore how, why, and in what ways has the figure of the brain come to permeate so many different areas of thinking and practice in academic and commercial life. What are the consequences for academia, business, commerce and policy?



Background:

The last twenty years have seen unprecedented advances in the neurosciences, in fields such as psychopharmacology, neurology and behavioural genetics. A growing number of ethicists, social scientists, legal scholars and philosophers have begun to analyze the social, legal and ethical implications of these advances, from the use of fMRI imaging in legal cases, to the medical benefits and risks of the increasing prescription of psychotropic drugs such as Prozac and Ritalin. Some attention has been paid to the economic questions raised by the commercial development and application of new technologies, and the extent to which subfields such as neuroeconomics and neuromarketing are generating commercially and clinically valuable findings. The conference aims to bring together academics and practitioners from this wide range of disciplines to attempt a critical evaluation of the current state and future prospects for neuro thinking.



Call for papers:

The Organising Committee welcomes proposals for individual papers which seek to make empirically based and conceptually innovative contributions to the analysis of the persuasive power of neuroscience in and outside academia. We particularly welcome papers that relate to the themes below, however we are also happy to consider contributions which address the general topic of the conference but do not align directly with these themes.



Please send abstracts (300–600 words) to insisevents@sbs.ox.ac.uk. The deadline for submission of abstracts is 1 July 2010.



Themes:



1) The rise and current configuration of the international neuroindustry

The conference seeks to map the diffusion of neuroscientific technology and knowledge by examining in which disciplines and which business practices the figure of the brain has become prominent and why in other disciplines or practices this is not the case. We are particularly interested in historical research that explores how the prominence of the brain has come about. Can we also anticipate the demise of the brain and what will supplant it? After eyes, skin and brain – what will be the next site of human bodies and behaviour  which will be exploited commercially? In addition to mapping the diffusion of the figure of the brain and exploring its historical specificity this conference seeks to address how the brain as a trope organises scholarly and commercial thinking in different disciplines and business fields.



What then are the current and potential commercial application of the brain sciences, which companies are taking the lead in bringing new technologies to market, and how are policymakers and industry groups lobbying to change regulatory barriers toward the use of new technologies?



2) The economic and social value of the new brain sciences

As neurological and psychiatric disorders place a significant economic and social toll on the health of populations internationally, much optimism surrounds the hope that developments in the neurosciences will help to find treatments for disorders such as depression, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and autism spectrum disorders. To what extent is this optimism warranted? Scholars have pointed out that a) in the past, the development of novel biomedical technologies has often tended to increase societal inequalities because access to them has been available only to a minority, and b) often the expectation surrounding new biomedical treatments exceeds the reality of their clinical usefulness. This theme will address whether, much like the optimism surrounding the benefit of advances in pharmacogenomics and gene therapy, the clinical usefulness of advances in the neurosciences has been exaggerated. In addition, we welcome papers that critically address the commercialisation of the new brain sciences and its implications for research priorities.



3) The ethical and social implications of biomarkets and neuromarketing

Neuroeconomics – combining psychology, economics and neuroscience in order to understand the neural and social impulses behind decision-making – and neuromarketing – the study of the brain’s response to advertising techniques – are promising to revolutionize the fields of marketing and consumer choice. What are the likely consequences of this? What are the implications for consumer autonomy, the rise and pervasiveness of brand and advertising cultures, and the increasing adoption of reductive and/or deterministic models of human behaviour and decision-making? This theme will address the social, economic and political implications of new developments in neuroeconomics and neuromarketing, through drawing on the insights of ethicists, clinicians and industry representatives.



Logistics:

There is no cost for the event, but accommodation and travel expenses are not provided.

Computational advertising is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary research field that crosses  a variety of established scientific disciplines, including computer science, artificial intelligence, advertising, marketing, linguistics, statistics, economics, psychology, and sociology. Specifically, computational advertising can be viewed as a scientific sub-discipline at the intersection of information retrieval, statistical modeling, machine learning, classification, optimization, microeconomics, large-scale search, and text analysis. In contrast with traditional advertising, computational advertising provides an ideal platform for monitoring, tracking, gauging, and evaluating advertising campaigns and user behaviors,  and thus providing the basis for exact, personalized advertising with quantifiable results. The central challenge of computational advertising lies in finding the ""best match"" between a specific user in a specific context and a suitable advertisement, which requires leveraging the information associated with the user, publisher, and advertiser. With the rapid proliferation of novel digital applications related to the Web, location-based mobile services, and social community, there have been emerging rich advertising forms such as display advertising, contextual advertising, textual advertising, sponsored search, content match, real-time bidding advertising, viral advertising, mobile advertising, and social advertising. These advertising forms demand sophisticated mechanisms, processes, and strategies in order to achieve satisfying results.



This special issue aims to report on and discuss the state of the art in computational advertising — particularly, new ideas, methods, and innovative applications. The topics of interest for this special issue include, but are not limited to:



Computational advertising forms

Online/Web advertising

Graphical advertising

Display advertising

Sponsored search advertising

Search engine marketing (SEM)

Contextual advertising

Textual advertising

Location-based and mobile advertising

Social advertising

Psychological advertising

Real-time bidding

MOTIVATION



Viele Branchen befinden sich in derselben Situation: Unternehmen bedienen ihre Kunden über konventionelle Massenkanäle, obwohl auch Kenntnis über Ort, Situation und Erreichbarkeit vorhanden ist. Mit diesem Wissen könnte man personalisiert agieren - Leistungen anbieten, die zu aktuellen Bedürfnissen des Kunden passen, Produkte bündeln, Vertriebskanäle bei Partnern nutzen. Es entstehen Orchestrierung und Kollaboration, und Social Business interagiert mit der Meinung des Kunden zum Produkt.



URSPRUNG UND BEDEUTUNG



Das aktuelle Buchprojekt entstand aus dem Arbeitskreis ""Marktplätze im Umbruch"" des Leitprojekts des Freistaates Bayern ""Das Mobile Internet der Zukunft"", das von der LMU München geleitet wird. Acht Firmen und die LMU München arbeiten dabei gemeinschaftlich an verwertbaren Innovationen - an der Gewinnung neuer Erkenntnisse und deren Vermarktung - auf einem Markt der Chancen bietet, da er sich im Umbruch befindet.



Diese Aktivitäten sollen nun über den Arbeitskreis hinaus erweitert werden. Das Land Bayern und der Bund betonen nachhaltig die Bedeutung der Digitalisierung der Gesellschaft und deren Chancen für die Wirtschaft. Gemäß Strategiepapier ""Digital Bavaria"" und aktuellem Koalitionsvertrag des Bundes wird dieses Thema Gegenstand zahlreicher weiterer Aktivitäten sein.

Indeed, the exploration of these positive elements associated with the integration of environment, marketing strategy represents potentially valuable contributions to marketing research. Papers investigating such issues are encouraged for submission.



Environment poses new challenges, such as Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal & Ethical. Certainly, the Environment poses delicate to challenges for any company that serves diverse markets, but particularly when those markets are at different stages of development.

Offering different products, pricing, and promotional messages to diverse segments becomes more complex and hot. When information can be transmitted so quickly and at a bargain price, customers and business partners have greater ability to compare marketing strategies directed to them with those deployed elsewhere.



Such comparisons between emerging and developed markets can be particularly problematic because there are valid reasons why the market offering may vary substantially. The needs, capabilities and finances of marketers and customers in emerging markets differ greatly from those in developed countries. Physical, social and legal infrastructures are diverse. Emerging markets face issues of exploding growth and tremendous opportunity. In developed countries, demographic trends, economic crises, and concerns about new competitors from emerging markets generate insecurity regarding long-term competitiveness. The challenge in these countries isn't managing unstable growth. The question is: Will the recent crises lead to stagnation or will marketers and customers recover in economic activity and stable, to long-term growth? Disregarding such critical differences while superficially comparing marketing strategies can lead to negative reactions.



The study of Marketing for challenging environment; welcome for papers, encourage submissions regarding emerging markets that develop theory, identify and address shortcomings in the generalizability of widely-accepted theory or findings, or highlight unexamined or under-researched topics."

These changes are bringing in new challenges for the organizations, setting in new trends and also opening new opportunities. The topic for this national conference will focus on these changes and will help us get better insights.

 

The challenges include financial management in a fast changing environment with constantly fluctuating exchange rates, pressure from the analysts about the utilization of financial resources, expectations on ROI, wealth creation and maintaining the profitability. The marketing department faces challenges of constantly changing consumer preferences, highly competitive environment with aggressive competitors,product life cycle getting shortened, technology dictating the trends of new products, multiple touch points for customers and the ever present substitute products challenging the dominance of traditional products. The Human Resources faces the challenge of an increasingly aging yet active population, decline of the nuclear family and the rise of alternative households, four generations working side-by-side,with a fifth on the way, a workplace that is growing more diverse and more blended and the need for a higher purpose in the workplace.

 

Along with the challenges comes opportunities for organizations. The growing aspirations of customers,the fast changing technologies, environmental consciousness, more business friendly governments,globalization and internet provide a wide range of opportunities for organizations"

Thursday, November 29th 2012

School of Management Léonard de Vinci (EMLV) – La Défense, Paris



Internet has disrupted several industries over the past few years. It has changed the way we do business and how consumers behave. Among the elements that contribute to this phenomenon we can cite the wealth of detailed information obtained with every purchase, the spreading of virtual communities and the growth in social media usage in recent years (Twitter, Fan Pages, Blogs, etc. .. Pinterest), the coming of age of the so-called “Generation Y”, the instantaneous insights on consumer profiles, m-commerce and the development of mobile tools (smartphones, tablets), etc. To what extent are the foundations of consumer behaviour being shaken?



The speed of evolution of the Internet does not always allow companies to realize the implications of new consumer behaviour trends. Indeed, the digital world has changed how we look at customers. Consumers increasingly explore and buy through the Internet and share their experience through the use of digital media. Buying and sharing are two inherent aspects of the new consumption experience. Behaviours are increasingly affected by the way we use the web to make our purchasing decisions, and how we influence, test, protest, praise, share, recommend or learn about products or services.



This represents a unique opportunity for academics to revisit their assumptions in this broad field of research in order to outline the main trends in this on-going transformation.



The Research Symposium will be focused on digital consumption. The themes below are meant as guidelines and are not exhaustive:



• E-CRM

• Social Media

• Virtual Communities

• Collaborative consumer behaviour

• Online-Reputation Management

• Digital Experience

• Virtual agents

• Crowdsourcing

• Behavioural advertising

• Online Market research

• M-Commerce

• Geolocation

• Facebook Fan Management

• Blogs and social influence

• Interpersonal communication

• Active consumers

• Generation Y

• Viral marketing

• New business models

• Self-Care

• Use of digital products

• After sales

• Self-Quantified experiences



Following the conference the best papers will be submitted for publication to the Revue Française de Marketing. The Scientific Committee will conduct the selection of papers to be submitted for review and approval by the editorial board of the RFM. The selected papers must be translated into French by their authors. 



Paper submissions to the symposium may be written in French or English. The submission guidelines are available on RFM.



Objectives

The symposium aims to gather researchers around these issues and to generate discussion, debate and exchange of experiences on these topics in order to better understand their implications. We wish to contribute the academic perspective to the knowledge building on these different themes.

Computational advertising is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary research field that crosses  a variety of established scientific disciplines, including computer science, artificial intelligence, advertising, marketing, linguistics, statistics, economics, psychology, and sociology. Specifically, computational advertising can be viewed as a scientific sub-discipline at the intersection of information retrieval, statistical modeling, machine learning, classification, optimization, microeconomics, large-scale search, and text analysis. In contrast with traditional advertising, computational advertising provides an ideal platform for monitoring, tracking, gauging, and evaluating advertising campaigns and user behaviors,  and thus providing the basis for exact, personalized advertising with quantifiable results. The central challenge of computational advertising lies in finding the ""best match"" between a specific user in a specific context and a suitable advertisement, which requires leveraging the information associated with the user, publisher, and advertiser. With the rapid proliferation of novel digital applications related to the Web, location-based mobile services, and social community, there have been emerging rich advertising forms such as display advertising, contextual advertising, textual advertising, sponsored search, content match, real-time bidding advertising, viral advertising, mobile advertising, and social advertising. These advertising forms demand sophisticated mechanisms, processes, and strategies in order to achieve satisfying results.



This special issue aims to report on and discuss the state of the art in computational advertising — particularly, new ideas, methods, and innovative applications. The topics of interest for this special issue include, but are not limited to:

Desire, Identity and Self-Gifts



Pandemics afflict societies through the established relationships that people have created with the environment, others and, themselves. A critical situation pushes human behaviour towards different directions, some of them transient, others inevitable. The COVID-19 outbreak has brought about a paradigm shift in many aspects of consumer culture, including personal identity, social interactions and affiliations, and behaviours in the commercial marketplace.



Measures of complete and partial lockdown triggered significant changes in our social and consumption values, habits, and desires. Due to the closure of stationary retail stores and consumers' impossibility of pursuing their usual leisure activities, online shopping has become the only means for consumers to deal with consumer desire's intense and powerful emotions. Many consumers craved hedonistic products and services to satisfy the need for self-indulgence and personal pampering (Gopalan, 2020; Koch et al., 2020).



According to Belk et al. (2003), consumer desire is a passion born between consumption fantasies and social situational contexts. The self-reward theme of many self-gifts may well share something in common with consumer desire in terms of providing a moral rationalization for consumption (Belk et al., 2003).



In marketing literature, Tauber (1972) proposed that the search for “self-gratification” could be a motive for buying oneself “something nice.” During the late-eighties and nineties, references to self-gifts or to “giving to oneself” in Consumer Behaviour were addressed by several authors (Luomala & Laaksonen, 1999; Mick, 1986; Sherry et al., 1993, 1995; Sherry & McGrath, 1989; Williams & Burns, 1994). The authors (Mick & Demoss, 1990) defined self-gifts as personally symbolic self-communication through special indulgences that tend to be premeditated and highly context-bound. 



As Mick & Demoss (1990) put it, A good self consoles the real self when uncontrollable factors thwart hopes or disrupt life. Conversely, more recently, research indicates that self-gifts bought in some severe contexts seem to provide a lasting therapeutic effect linked to their symbolic value while justifies a sense of deservedness (Heath et al., 2015).



While representing a plurality of distinct theoretical approaches and research goals, Consumer Culture Theory (CCT) researchers share a common theoretical orientation toward the study of cultural complexity that links their respective research efforts (Arnould & Thompson, 2005). Understanding self-rewards as achieved from a CCT analysis is essential to our understanding of marketing/consumer research in today’s times. Given that so little is known about self-gifts in uncertainty scenarios, the overriding goal of this workshop is to promote a discussion both conceptual and empirical about the value of self-gift in consumer identity work.



Accordingly, we encourage submissions that embody the spirit of Consumer Culture Theory as informing and contributing pragmatic to the topic!

In view of these expectations, there are the externalizations of interdisciplinary issues. Many papers about data utilization have been published, and several approaches for analyzing data have been shared widely. However, there are only a limited number of studies on the process of cross-disciplinary data exchange and collaboration and its ecosystem. Since this process encompasses various activities of different stakeholders, it is difficult to evaluate the patterns or processes quantitatively. Moreover, in the data market, there are not only big data but also small data necessary for decision making. It is essential to discuss the dynamics of such a network of heterogeneous data in different fields.



To address these gaps, we propose to hold a third edition of the session to discuss the processes and interactions among data, humans, and society –Data Marketing as Cross-disciplinary Data Exchange and Collaboration (CDEC). The topics taken up at CDEC will involve practical issues such as the analytical tasks performed using data, solutions for challenging social issues, and cross-disciplinary data collaboration and its process. Our special session will target not only cleanly formatted homogenous data, but also heterogeneous data that affect human behaviors, thoughts, and intentions across different domains. We will also focus on a discussion to obtain tacit knowledge of artificial intelligence and data mining by analysis and synthesis. In addition to these research fields, we will attempt to take a cognitive approach toward observing the processes of knowledge discovery and data exchange. It is expected that conflicts and inconsistencies may arise owing to differences in opinion when stakeholders from different knowledge domains have discussions on data-driven decision making. We believe that this special session focusing on the process of cross-disciplinary data exchange and collaboration will have great significance, not only on academia, but also on the society as a whole.



This year, we are planning to expand the scope beyond the results of data mining, and present, share, and discuss the entire process from data design to analysis by setting the theme as “Designing Data Exchange Ecosystem for Human-AI Collaborative Society.”



We call for anyone interested in the following topics related to CDEC:

Marketing activities play a central role in delivering value to both customers and shareholders and it is evident that digital technology plays a significant part in this. Technology allows marketers to collect, manage and analyse vast amounts of real-time data on customers that drives strategic marketing decisions and builds customer insight. This insight can also drive communications and here technology also allows marketers to get much closer to customers than ever before, engaging and co-creating with them in a relational and interactive manner through social media tools. Combined, the use of technology in both data and communications represents an extremely powerful approach to marketing.



The underpinning of AM2012 is that marketing research has yet to fully catch this technology wave. Where are the conceptual models that fit this reality? Where is the academic research that makes sense of this digital tidal wave?  



We encourage submissions of papers that consider the undoubtedly disruptive role that technology is having on marketing, in an effort to bring theory closer to practice. In practice, technology is driving marketing in areas such as social media, search engine marketing, customer insight and web analytics to name but a few. We need to catch up to ensure that technology is only ever an enabler of underlying marketing principles, not the driver of marketing actions.



The AM2012 Conference Committee invites submission of competitive papers, working papers and posters for the 2012 Conference.  All papers must be submitted electronically via the online submissions facility, before the deadline of Friday 30th December 2011.



Please note that the theme of the special issue of the Journal of Marketing Management related to the conference will also be ‘Marketing: catching the technology wave’.

Special Issue: Technological Impacts on Market Attitudes and Behaviors



Guest Editors:

Paul Baines, Cranfield University, UK



Original research and review manuscripts are invited for a forthcoming special issue of Psychology & Marketing that will explore the impact of technology on market attitudes and behavior. Technology has had a profound effect on twentieth century society world-wide. In the twenty-first century, we are living through a further profound change, caused by the development of the internet and its associated technologies. These technologies have substantially altered the way we do business in new and exciting ways. This issue is therefore intended to provide new psychological perspectives into the practice and theory of how technology interacts with opinions, attitudes, beliefs and behaviors in different markets. Markets here might constitute social, public, political, business-to-business or

consumer markets.



A non-exhaustive list of suggested topics follows:



- The relative importance of public opinion versus consumer opinion as mediated by social media and other digital technologies.

- The relative effects of different forms of advertising, particularly digital advertising, on customer cognitions and behaviors.

- The rise of social media movements associated with social, political, and commercial marketing campaigns.

- Differences in attitudes and behaviors of customers using e-commerce versus m-commerce platforms.

- The production, spread, and dissemination of rumors and conspiracies against companies, products and persons across the internet and other digital technologies and their relative effects.

- The psychological effects of being part of a brand community and its relative influence, if any, on purchase behavior.

- How anonymity online affects consumer behavior, including customer behavior in so-called ‘dark markets’.



Manuscripts may contain a maximum of 50 double-spaced pages (including all figures, tables, references, and appendices) and must be received in electronic form (Microsoft WORD) no later than December 31st, 2015. Citations and references must be in APA style.

Computational advertising is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary research field that crosses a variety of established scientific disciplines, including computer science, artificial intelligence, advertising, marketing, linguistics, statistics, economics, psychology, and sociology. Specifically, computational advertising can be viewed as a scientific sub-discipline at the intersection of information retrieval, statistical modeling, machine learning, classification, optimization, microeconomics, large-scale search, and text analysis. In contrast with traditional advertising, computational advertising provides an ideal platform for monitoring, tracking, gauging, and evaluating advertising campaigns and user behaviors, and thus providing the basis for exact, personalized advertising with quantifiable results. The central challenge of computational advertising lies in finding the ""best match"" between a specific user in a specific context and a suitable advertisement, which requires leveraging the information associated with the user, publisher, and advertiser. With the rapid proliferation of novel digital applications related to the Web, location-based mobile services, and social community, there have been emerging rich advertising forms such as display advertising, contextual advertising, textual advertising, sponsored search, content match, real-time bidding advertising, viral advertising, mobile advertising, and social advertising.

Publikationsdatum: 20.09.2019



Personalisierte und dynamische Preise sind in Geschäftszweigen wie der Hotellerie, bei Reiseveranstaltern und Fluganbietern sowie im Online-Einzelhandel bereits gängige Praxis – unter dem Begriff «Dynamic Pricing» gewinnt die Preispolitik in einer digitalisierten Welt an Bedeutung. Dynamisches Preismanagement ist eine Preisstrategie bei Unternehmen, die Preise für Produkte oder Dienstleistungen automatisch an die jeweilige Nachfrage des Kunden anpasst: Seit2017 Jahr werden z.B. in den Tankstellenshops von Lekkerland nachts, bei geringerer Konkurrenz, die Preise leicht erhöht – möglich machen es elektronische Preisschilder. Selbst schweizerische Skigebiete setzten seit der Saison 17/18 auf neue Pricing-Konzepte: Die «Aletsch-Arena» passt die Preise ihrer Tageskarten je nach Wetter, Pistenqualität und Buchungszeitraum an und auf «skinow.ch» können Skifahrer den Preis von diversen Skigebieten, via Gebot, selbst bestimmen. Die Beispiele zeigen, dass sich, durch den technologischen Fortschritt, neue Chancen für das Preismanagement von Unternehmen ergeben. Unternehmen können heute die Preise mit zunehmender Dynamik und nach vordefinierten Regeln anpassen. So können Online-Händler beispielsweise sekundenschnell und automatisch auf Preisänderungen der Konkurrenz oder Nachfrageschwankungen reagieren, um so ihre Wettbewerbsfähigkeit oder die Marge zu erhöhen. Auch der stationäre Handel kann durch neue Technologien, wie z.B. elektronische Preisschilder, Pricing-Methoden aus dem Online-Handel übernehmen. Gleichzeitig sind die Kunden, dank der steigenden Preistransparenz im Internet, immer besser über aktuelle Preise informiert. Vor und sogar während des Einkaufs vergleichen preisbewusste Konsumenten, via Smartphone, bequem Preise auf Vergleichsportalen. Eine weitere Herausforderung besteht darin, die neuen Pricing-Massnahmen so auszugestalten, dass sie von der Öffentlichkeit nicht als unfair wahrgenommen werden. 2015 wurde Amazon massiv für aggressives Preismanagement kritisiert, da am Valentinstag alleine über eine Million Preise um bis zu 240% angepasst wurden. Auch deutsche Verbraucherschützer warnen verstärkt vor dynamischem Pricing. 



Vor diesem Hintergrund stellt sich die Frage nach geeigneten Pricing-Strategien und deren erfolgreiche Umsetzung im Zeitalter der Digitalisierung. Wir suchen nach praxisbezogenen Beiträgen, die Unternehmen helfen sollen, die neuen Möglichkeiten im Preismanagement zu erkennen, um diese erfolgreich umzusetzen. Ausgewählte, aber keinesfalls abschliessende Themenbereiche sind dabei:

•	Best Practice Beispiele: Anpassung der Pricing-Strategie im Zeitalter der Digitalisierung

•	Chancen und Risiken von Dynamic Pricing im Online- und Offline-Handel

•	Einfluss von zunehmender Preistransparenz auf das Einkaufsverhalten

•	Preisfairness-Wahrnehmung, Preiswissen und Vertrauen der Kunden"

The scope of the Workshop



In business environment data warehousing - the practice of creating huge, central stores of customer data that can be used throughout the enterprise - is becoming more and more common practice and, as a consequence, the importance of data mining is growing stronger. Data mining allows indeed to extract the most important information from such vast data and to uncover previously unknown patterns that may be relevant to current business problems, thereby helping business managers to transform data into business decisions.



In marketing data mining has several and profitable applications. It can help to identify market segments containing customers with high-profit potential, and then build campaigns that favorably impact their behavior; to detect customers dissatisfied and ready to leave, and then align campaigns more closely with their needs; to outline profiles of prospective customers, and then increase the response rates of the acquisition campaigns, and so on.



The papers will be reviewed by the International Program Committee of ICDM

The goals of this workshop are to:



    to provide a forum for identifying important contributions and opportunities for

    research on data mining as it applies to marketing

    to promote the systematic study of how to apply data mining to marketing

    to show case applications.



Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):



    Applications in Marketing

    Methods for User Profiling

    Mining Insurance Data

    E-Marketing with Data Mining

    Logfile Analysis

    Churn Management

    Association Rules for Marketing Applications

    Online Targeting and Controlling

    Behavioral Targeting

    Juridical Conditions of E-Marketing, Online Targeting

    Control of Online-Marketing Activities

    New Trends in Online Marketing

    Aspects of E-Mailing Activities and Newsletter Mailing

Special Issue on



Social Media and Social Networking in Industrial Marketing



CALL FOR PAPERS

Deadline for Submission February 28, 2015



Social media and social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn have become extremely popular over the past five years. The adoption and use of these channels apply not only to social activities but to commercial sectors as well. Companies now use video, blogs, podcasting, social network communities and other online media to release news and directly approach customers. These marketing platforms operate 24/7 and provide attractive interactive environments for customers and companies. 



The commercial adoption of social media has attracted widespread attention in such academic disciplines as marketing, information systems, human resources and organizational behaviour. However, there remains a shortage of theoretical frameworks on how those platforms can increase brand equity and enhance business performance in business-to-business markets. While research has focused on the marketing of consumers’ products rather than business-to-business marketing and channel relationships, it is clear that social media also facilitates collaboration between trading partners through innovative, visual, and timely communicative media including, in particular mobile channels. 



A survey done by Duke University and the Chief Marketing Council 2013 shows that current social media spending is about 6.6% of the total marketing budget and it will grow to 9.1% in twelve months and to 15.8% in five years indicating a 140% increase. Nonetheless, the survey also reveals that only 15% of the companies studied have proven quantitative benefits, with 36% showing some qualitative impacts, and a significant 49% unsure of any benefits. Interestingly, the results also conclude that between 2011 and 2013 the effectiveness measurement of using social media for marketing has not changed. So despite that the importance and wide recognition of using social media and social networking for marketing as reported by practitioners in the survey, the companies, themselves, are not effectively integrating social media with their marketing strategies.



Although the social media and social networking trend is promising, it is not yet clear whether or not these socio-technologies can be applied to industrial marketing. As mentioned, theoretical frameworks and proven methodologies using social media to create the content and relationship building processes that can create effective marketing and networking efforts are lacking. There is also a need to identify constructs and formulate models for measuring the return on investment of social medial adoption in the B2B market place. Little is known how to maximize the utilization of social media and networking to enhance collaboration between trading partners for distribution and product development and to increase brand equity. Better understanding of how and why organizations choose their practices for utilizing these platforms has significant implications for industrial marketing. 



As such, the objectives of this special issue will reflect the most recent advances on the marketing theories and the organizational adoption of social media and social network for industrial marketing and branding and to explore future research directions. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:



	Advertising of industrial products via social media and social networking sites

	Theoretical development and extension of relevant networking and marketing theories applied to business markets

	Social Media and Best Practice in industrial organizations

	Social media case studies in industrial marketing management – the story of launching, producing, and maintaining market leads and gaining profits

	Issues related to B2B brand equity and recognition 

	Frameworks for industrial corporate branding

	Customer services and experiences

	Industrial Content Marketing 

	B2B relationships in cyberspace

	Marketing capabilities and relational performance 

	Social marketing in social media

	Marketing personnel and information systems 

	Strategies in industrial marketing

	Collaborative projects with partners via social networking 

	Social media and viral marketing in the industrial market

	Social networking and supply chains

	Social media (big) data and business marketing strategies



In this special issue, we especially seek original contributions of successful real-life applications and empirical research of social media and social networking and their impacts on marketing theory. Conceptual papers and other related topics, supported by strong theoretical background, are also welcome. 



Manuscript Preparation and Submission 

Manuscripts should comply with the scope, standards, format and editorial policy of the Industrial Marketing Management.  Manuscripts should be submitted as an e-mail attachment with a single MSWord file containing the complete manuscript (Title, text, figures, tables, appendices, references) to the guest editors with a copy to plaplaca@journalimm.com.

An Interdisciplinary Conference (Online) at Coventry University London, London, UK

In association with the Fashion Research Network 



Thursday 22nd-Friday 23rd July 2021



Keynotes:

Dr Patsy Perry, Manchester Metropolitan University, UK 

Dr Marco Pedroni, University of Ferrara, Italy

Dr Socrates Karidis, Coventry University London, UK 



Fashion is the world’s second largest industry, a large-scale global employer encompassing agriculture, manufacturing, artisanal craftmanship, design, logistics and retail. Publicly considered and promoted as glamorously effortless, behind-the-scenes a large amount of preparation, planning and forecasting is made to engage global fashion consumers in the processes and culture of fashion driving desire and consumption. Increasingly, fashion is a global business sector, which is having to come up with answers and solutions for a range of challenges and opportunities; sometimes planned, sometimes spontaneously, often at a company rather than sector level. Yet is now the time to think, and act, more strategically? Are these now more a hindrance than a help to serving the needs and desires of fashion’s consumers? What are the drivers behind fashion’s challenges and opportunities? Does there need to be a full re-think of the processes and systems, which support the fashion sector? What new business models need to be evolved? What role does technology and sustainability play within this? Who are the new leaders and mentors to guide us in this? 



Scholars and fashion business innovators are invited to submit applications for a 15-minute paper on the following key themes of the conference: 



•	New Fashion Retail Business Models and Strategies 

•	Modern Approaches to Fashion Marketing and Branding 

•	Local and Global Perspectives on Disrupting the Fashion Consumer 

•	Innovations in Fashion Technology and Digital 

•	Contemporary Innovations in Sustainability, Value Streams and the Circular Economy 

•	Culture, History and Artisanship in the Context of Global Fashion Business 

•	Leadership, Diversity and the Role of Mentors in Global Fashion Business Innovation 



We invite proposals for 15-minute papers on the themes outlined here. Paper proposals should contain a short biography (max 60 words), extended abstract (max 1000 words) and up to 5 key words with full contact details including the email address(es) of the speaker(s). Entries should be emailed as a Word.doc file to the conference organisers Nathaniel Dafydd Beard (nathaniel.beard@coventry.ac.uk) and Ranjit Thind (ranjit.thind@coventry.ac.uk) by Friday 30th April 2021.





Additional Information: 

No fee will be payable by speakers whose extended abstract submission is successful. This conference will be held online. Please note no bursary or monetary support can be offered for travel or other expenses. A letter of support in order to facilitate funding applications via your own academic and/or commercial organisation can be provided on request to the conference organisers. 



Conference proceedings may be audio recorded and/or filmed and speakers will likely be asked to contribute to social media promotion and/or be interviewed in the run-up to the conference. 



Conference organisers will be working with a reputable academic publisher to develop a publication based on the papers and conference proceedings. All accepted papers will be considered for potential publication.
